00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:04,370
We go way back to one of the first videos where we talked about primitive types.

2
00:00:04,380 --> 00:00:06,450
I just gave you a brief overview of them.

3
00:00:06,450 --> 00:00:09,670
We've now covered number string boolean.

4
00:00:09,690 --> 00:00:12,990
We haven't really talked about null or undefined at all.

5
00:00:12,990 --> 00:00:16,800
We've seen undefined once or twice now we're just going to quickly run through them.

6
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:22,890
They are very simple as far as primitive types go, but they can be confusing for beginners as far as

7
00:00:22,890 --> 00:00:25,530
what what they each do and how they're different.

8
00:00:25,530 --> 00:00:32,910
Both of them represent the idea of nothingness or something not being there or the lack of a value,

9
00:00:32,910 --> 00:00:34,830
but there is a distinction between them.

10
00:00:34,830 --> 00:00:41,100
So both are primitives and we can just type them in the browser and the console null undefined.

11
00:00:41,100 --> 00:00:44,970
We could make a variable and set it explicitly to them if we wanted to.

12
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:46,890
But let's talk about the main difference.

13
00:00:47,010 --> 00:00:48,480
NULL is a value.

14
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:49,470
It's a primitive type.

15
00:00:49,470 --> 00:00:55,920
That is the intentional absence of any value and you assign it yourself so you can make a variable and

16
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:56,820
set it to null.

17
00:00:57,450 --> 00:00:59,100
So here's an example of that.

18
00:00:59,100 --> 00:01:05,010
We might have a variable called logged in user and at the beginning of our application there is no logged

19
00:01:05,010 --> 00:01:05,730
in user.

20
00:01:05,730 --> 00:01:08,370
So you will explicitly set it to null.

21
00:01:08,370 --> 00:01:09,540
You make it nothing.

22
00:01:09,540 --> 00:01:14,430
You're telling JavaScript there is a value here, it's just the value of nothing.

23
00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:18,420
And then if someone logs in, you could set it to Alan Rickman.

24
00:01:18,780 --> 00:01:22,710
And then if Alan Rickman logs out, rest in peace, I think.

25
00:01:22,710 --> 00:01:23,370
Is he dead?

26
00:01:23,370 --> 00:01:24,180
I think he is.

27
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:25,320
Yes, he is.

28
00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:26,460
Rest in peace, Alan.

29
00:01:26,730 --> 00:01:29,220
We could then reset it to NULL afterwards.

30
00:01:29,220 --> 00:01:33,780
So it is the explicit value of nothingness, of emptiness.

31
00:01:33,780 --> 00:01:34,950
It's null.

32
00:01:35,340 --> 00:01:37,020
Undefined is different.

33
00:01:37,410 --> 00:01:44,520
Undefined is a value that represents a variable that does not have a value assigned to it.

34
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:48,330
So it's kind of semantically annoying to explain.

35
00:01:48,480 --> 00:01:54,360
But if you think about when we've seen undefined so far, if we tried to access a string like LOL square

36
00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:56,820
brackets of four, we get undefined.

37
00:01:56,820 --> 00:01:58,680
There is nothing defined there.

38
00:01:58,710 --> 00:02:06,060
We don't usually set something to be undefined our self and technically we can const you equals undefined

39
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:08,850
if we look at you it's undefined.

40
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:14,100
Normally though undefined is a value we get back from JavaScript.

41
00:02:14,310 --> 00:02:21,090
Like if we initialize a variable let's color but we don't give it a value so we declare it.

42
00:02:21,090 --> 00:02:22,740
Sorry, we don't initialize it.

43
00:02:23,220 --> 00:02:26,940
If we look at color it exists, but the value is undefined.

44
00:02:26,940 --> 00:02:28,860
We never defined a value for it.

45
00:02:28,890 --> 00:02:31,500
Compare that with something like current user.

46
00:02:32,700 --> 00:02:37,350
We could explicitly set that to nothing and then change it later on if needed.

47
00:02:37,350 --> 00:02:40,770
So both of them represent kind of similar concepts.

48
00:02:40,770 --> 00:02:45,270
So we manually or explicitly assign the value of null to a variable.

49
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:50,250
Again, it's the intentional absence of any value when you want something to be empty.

50
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:55,170
Undefined is not necessarily saying something is intentionally empty.

51
00:02:55,170 --> 00:02:58,740
It means that there is no defined value and it's nuanced.

52
00:02:58,740 --> 00:03:00,150
But that is different.

53
00:03:00,150 --> 00:03:03,150
Now, if you're confused about this, you don't feel super great about it.

54
00:03:03,150 --> 00:03:05,430
You will see undefined all the time.

55
00:03:05,580 --> 00:03:06,570
We've already seen it before.

56
00:03:06,570 --> 00:03:12,180
As I mentioned, trying to access characters that don't exist or indices that don't exist in a string.

57
00:03:12,180 --> 00:03:14,970
We'll see it when we get to arrays and objects.

58
00:03:14,970 --> 00:03:22,470
It's very common to see null is something you yourself used, you set something to null and it's not

59
00:03:22,470 --> 00:03:26,670
totally uncommon, but you won't deal with it as often as you'll see undefined.

60
00:03:27,060 --> 00:03:28,590
So don't panic about those.

61
00:03:28,590 --> 00:03:31,590
But those are the last two primitive types we had on our list.

62
00:03:31,590 --> 00:03:37,320
We've now covered numbers a lot about strings, a little about booleans and a little about null and

63
00:03:37,320 --> 00:03:38,070
undefined.

64
00:03:38,070 --> 00:03:40,050
Next, we're going to Boolean Land.

65
00:03:40,050 --> 00:03:43,830
We have a lot to talk about as far as adding logic to our applications.
