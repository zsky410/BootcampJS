1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:03,310
Next up, let's talk about something called the math object.

2
00:00:03,330 --> 00:00:05,510
This is a relatively quick topic.

3
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:08,580
Definitely not long enough to merit its own section.

4
00:00:08,580 --> 00:00:12,430
And it kind of has to do with the stuff we've been talking about, primitives and numbers.

5
00:00:12,450 --> 00:00:19,230
The math object is a collection of different pieces of mathematical functionality, along with some

6
00:00:19,230 --> 00:00:20,700
mathematical constants.

7
00:00:20,700 --> 00:00:28,380
So you probably won't be using math pie very often or math E for Euler's number, but they are available

8
00:00:28,380 --> 00:00:28,920
to you.

9
00:00:28,950 --> 00:00:33,900
Most of what we use or what I use the math object for are its methods.

10
00:00:33,900 --> 00:00:37,530
So just like strings, we have some common methods that we've talked about.

11
00:00:37,530 --> 00:00:44,640
The math object has methods like rounding or exponential action or finding absolute value.

12
00:00:44,730 --> 00:00:49,410
One that will really use a lot is actually random numbers, which we'll come back to in a moment.

13
00:00:49,410 --> 00:00:51,840
Let's start with a quick look at the math object.

14
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:55,410
We haven't really talked about objects at all in this case.

15
00:00:55,410 --> 00:01:01,770
Think of the math object as just a collection of math functionality, different pieces of or different

16
00:01:01,770 --> 00:01:05,069
actions that have to do with math and numbers in some way.

17
00:01:05,190 --> 00:01:12,420
They're collected into this object called math, and it does start with an uppercase M If we try it

18
00:01:12,420 --> 00:01:16,470
out with a lowercase m, we won't get anything unless we use uppercase.

19
00:01:16,470 --> 00:01:19,290
M Math is just there for us to use.

20
00:01:19,710 --> 00:01:21,270
We have access to it.

21
00:01:21,270 --> 00:01:28,380
And if I type math dot, I can look at the autocomplete in my console and I'll see tons of different

22
00:01:28,380 --> 00:01:31,290
methods, different pieces of functionality.

23
00:01:31,410 --> 00:01:37,880
So something like math pie is not actually a method, it's just a value I can look at.

24
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:43,800
Probably not that useful most of the time until you get to doing things with maybe geometry or some

25
00:01:43,800 --> 00:01:48,870
sort of game where you have a collision detection radius around your spaceship or something.

26
00:01:49,140 --> 00:01:56,070
But some of the more useful methods in here include things like math flaw, which expects us to pass

27
00:01:56,070 --> 00:01:59,640
in a number like 3.6, five seven.

28
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:03,360
And it well, I used a comma there, but it also works.

29
00:02:03,720 --> 00:02:07,800
It's going to chop off the decimal point so it doesn't round.

30
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:13,590
I could have 3.9, nine, nine, nine and a bunch of nines and I still get three as a result.

31
00:02:13,590 --> 00:02:15,030
It just chops that off.

32
00:02:15,150 --> 00:02:19,380
But we also have math round and math out round does round.

33
00:02:19,380 --> 00:02:25,530
So if I have math out round of 4.6, we get five, but 4.4 is rounded down to four.

34
00:02:25,980 --> 00:02:35,640
We also have math, pow, math power where we can pass in two numbers like seven and two, and this

35
00:02:35,640 --> 00:02:38,460
will take seven and raise it to the second power.

36
00:02:39,420 --> 00:02:42,960
Or I could do seven to the seventh power and get a very large number.

37
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:47,580
Other than that, let's see, is there anything worth bringing up?

38
00:02:47,580 --> 00:02:55,380
We've got tons of methods around trigonometry, cosine and sine tangent, all this stuff.

39
00:02:55,380 --> 00:02:59,100
We've got some geometry getting the hypotenuse of a triangle.

40
00:02:59,130 --> 00:03:01,290
You probably won't use most of those all that often.

41
00:03:01,290 --> 00:03:06,930
But there is one method that we will use a lot, and it's really the main reason, the motivation for

42
00:03:06,930 --> 00:03:12,120
me, even showing you the math object and that method is called math random.

43
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:19,530
So math at random is going to be used to generate random numbers for us, which we do pretty frequently.

44
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:22,710
Depending on what you're actually doing in an application.

45
00:03:22,830 --> 00:03:28,650
You may not generate random numbers if you're creating a chat app, but in games or animations, for

46
00:03:28,650 --> 00:03:30,990
example, randomness can be important.

47
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:36,000
When we call math at random, we don't pass anything in to those parentheses.

48
00:03:36,540 --> 00:03:43,470
What it does is it returns a random decimal between zero and one, but not including one.

49
00:03:43,470 --> 00:03:51,030
So if we want a random number from 1 to 10, for example, we have to transform it in a couple of different

50
00:03:51,030 --> 00:03:51,510
ways.

51
00:03:51,510 --> 00:03:53,730
We have to work it into the form we want.

52
00:03:53,730 --> 00:03:59,220
We use this random decimal as a seed, but then we take advantage of some other methods and some other

53
00:03:59,220 --> 00:04:03,330
operators to get the random number into a workable form.

54
00:04:03,330 --> 00:04:05,370
Here's a step by step breakdown.

55
00:04:05,370 --> 00:04:08,310
Let's say I'm trying to get a random number from 1 to 10.

56
00:04:08,310 --> 00:04:14,580
I start with math at random that gives me a random decimal, as we just saw, from 0 to 1, not including

57
00:04:14,580 --> 00:04:15,120
one.

58
00:04:15,390 --> 00:04:17,399
Then we multiply it by ten.

59
00:04:17,399 --> 00:04:25,620
So now we have a random number with a decimal going from zero all the way up to 9.999999999999.

60
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:28,200
Then what we do is we floor it.

61
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:29,970
We we just saw a math flaw.

62
00:04:29,970 --> 00:04:31,380
It chops off the decimal.

63
00:04:31,410 --> 00:04:36,600
So that gives us a random whole number, a random integer from 0 to 9.

64
00:04:37,020 --> 00:04:41,280
And if we want to go from 1 to 10, then we simply add one.

65
00:04:41,820 --> 00:04:45,270
And usually we do this all in one line, which looks like this.

66
00:04:45,270 --> 00:04:50,940
If you're brand new to JavaScript, this looks like a lot, but it's something we do pretty frequently.

67
00:04:50,940 --> 00:04:54,840
Usually with this same pattern, we just change these values here.

68
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:59,910
So if I was trying to simulate a dice or a die roll from 1 to 6.

69
00:05:00,520 --> 00:05:02,620
I would start with math at random.

70
00:05:03,490 --> 00:05:06,280
Then I would multiply it by six.

71
00:05:06,280 --> 00:05:12,400
So that gives me a random number with a decimal between zero and six, not including six.

72
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:16,360
As you can see here, we went all the way up to 5.9.

73
00:05:16,900 --> 00:05:21,670
It's theoretically possible to go to 5.999999, nine and so on.

74
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:26,980
Then what we do after that is math for the whole thing.

75
00:05:27,310 --> 00:05:33,220
Math flaw which chops off the decimal point it doesn't round, it just removes that decimal.

76
00:05:33,250 --> 00:05:37,180
So now we end up with a number from 0 to 5.

77
00:05:37,570 --> 00:05:41,350
So I just got five and eventually I'll get zero.

78
00:05:41,770 --> 00:05:42,580
There we go.

79
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:49,030
0 to 5, which I could use for a dice roll, but most dice go from 1 to 6.

80
00:05:49,150 --> 00:05:51,880
So I could add one after that.

81
00:05:52,780 --> 00:05:56,350
And now we've got five for one.

82
00:05:56,350 --> 00:05:59,350
And eventually, hopefully, I hit six.

83
00:05:59,530 --> 00:06:00,400
There we go.

84
00:06:00,910 --> 00:06:06,070
So this can take a little bit of getting used to if you have experience with other languages, other

85
00:06:06,070 --> 00:06:12,760
programming languages, some of them will have a method like random integer and you pass it in to two

86
00:06:12,820 --> 00:06:13,150
numbers.

87
00:06:13,150 --> 00:06:17,200
I want a random integer from 50 to 100 and JavaScript.

88
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:18,840
You have to do that yourself.

89
00:06:18,850 --> 00:06:24,940
The only built in way of getting a random number is math random, which always gives us a decimal from

90
00:06:24,940 --> 00:06:25,900
0 to 1.
