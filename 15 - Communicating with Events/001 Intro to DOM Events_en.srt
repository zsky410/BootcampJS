1
00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:04,350
Hey, everyone, we've made it to one of my favorite sections, Dom events.

2
00:00:04,350 --> 00:00:06,750
So this is where things start to get real.

3
00:00:06,750 --> 00:00:12,060
This is where we can actually make cool applications that do things instead of just running code to,

4
00:00:12,090 --> 00:00:16,650
you know, change the color when the page loads or change the color of something when you type it into

5
00:00:16,650 --> 00:00:17,370
the console.

6
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:21,030
We need to understand those fundamentals selecting and manipulating.

7
00:00:21,030 --> 00:00:23,790
But we have one missing piece, which is events.

8
00:00:23,820 --> 00:00:29,970
Events allow us to run that code to create a new element or to remove an element or to change a color.

9
00:00:29,970 --> 00:00:35,700
When a specific interaction happens from a user and there are tons and tons of different events out

10
00:00:35,700 --> 00:00:40,050
there, this is a small sampling of some of the events that we can work with in our browser.

11
00:00:40,050 --> 00:00:45,240
If we take a look at any modern website these days, there are JavaScript events everywhere.

12
00:00:45,270 --> 00:00:46,200
Here's an example.

13
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:47,940
I was just using this website.

14
00:00:47,940 --> 00:00:50,520
Can I use dotcom a couple of videos ago?

15
00:00:50,790 --> 00:00:53,310
And let's see, there's a hover event.

16
00:00:53,310 --> 00:00:57,660
When I mouse over something, we get a pop up that's done via JavaScript.

17
00:00:57,690 --> 00:00:58,860
We've got click events.

18
00:00:58,860 --> 00:01:03,810
When I click, I'm loading new content, or at least showing and hiding different tabs.

19
00:01:04,110 --> 00:01:08,790
We've got other events like Let's see if I come up to the top.

20
00:01:08,790 --> 00:01:11,130
As I start typing, I'll get new search results.

21
00:01:11,130 --> 00:01:13,410
How about color?

22
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:15,150
There we go.

23
00:01:15,160 --> 00:01:18,970
A whole bunch of new search results that's all happening through JavaScript.

24
00:01:18,970 --> 00:01:24,280
So just on this one page, I have events when I'm typing that causes some code to run.

25
00:01:24,670 --> 00:01:30,790
I can type something invalid like that or I can type, transform and get results showing up.

26
00:01:30,790 --> 00:01:33,130
I've got hovers, I've got clicks.

27
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:35,470
I'm sure there are others that I'm skipping.

28
00:01:35,470 --> 00:01:37,360
And then here's another example.

29
00:01:37,450 --> 00:01:43,540
I just signed up for a Trello account in a throwaway email and it does a little tutorial for me.

30
00:01:43,540 --> 00:01:46,660
It wants me to make my first board, so I'm going to type a name in here.

31
00:01:46,660 --> 00:01:53,830
My first Trello board will be my life goals and notice what's happening as I type.

32
00:01:53,830 --> 00:01:55,960
Something is changing over here.

33
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:58,240
That is Dom manipulation.

34
00:01:58,240 --> 00:02:04,570
As I hit these keys, every time I type a single character, this element that's over here, whatever

35
00:02:04,570 --> 00:02:08,020
it is, a span, a paragraph, an H three, who knows?

36
00:02:08,199 --> 00:02:09,669
It's being updated.

37
00:02:09,699 --> 00:02:11,650
Maybe it's inner text, it's changing.

38
00:02:12,630 --> 00:02:13,470
Oh, click.

39
00:02:13,770 --> 00:02:15,300
That click is an event.

40
00:02:15,300 --> 00:02:17,070
So is this one to go back?

41
00:02:17,610 --> 00:02:20,100
I'll go forward though, and here's more of the same.

42
00:02:20,100 --> 00:02:24,660
I can change some titles of these default lists things to do.

43
00:02:24,660 --> 00:02:27,930
I add my exclamation points over here and it's updated here.

44
00:02:27,930 --> 00:02:29,940
So there's an event as I type.

45
00:02:30,030 --> 00:02:31,470
Something is happening over here.

46
00:02:31,470 --> 00:02:35,550
My interaction is triggering something and more of the same.

47
00:02:35,550 --> 00:02:37,560
I guess I can add some titles here.

48
00:02:37,590 --> 00:02:40,230
Things to do in my life.

49
00:02:40,230 --> 00:02:45,090
I would like to explore the ocean in Submarine.

50
00:02:46,740 --> 00:02:48,120
What else would I like to do?

51
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:55,050
I would also like to release an album I can hit Enter, by the way, which is a different event.

52
00:02:55,050 --> 00:02:59,610
I can click to move forward or I can just hit enter and now I moved a step forward.

53
00:03:00,510 --> 00:03:01,710
All right, then, over here.

54
00:03:01,710 --> 00:03:02,040
Let's see.

55
00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:03,990
I've got some other things I can add to my checklist.

56
00:03:03,990 --> 00:03:07,260
I'm just going to do some gibberish here, and I'm ready to get started.

57
00:03:07,380 --> 00:03:12,870
So those are all quick events and typing events, but now we've got other events I can drag to reorder

58
00:03:12,870 --> 00:03:13,500
things.

59
00:03:13,620 --> 00:03:15,630
This is an event in JavaScript.

60
00:03:15,630 --> 00:03:16,950
It's actually a couple of different things.

61
00:03:16,950 --> 00:03:21,780
There's dragging, there's dropping, there's when I mouse over, when I drag over something, notice

62
00:03:21,780 --> 00:03:27,120
how I get those like this shadow, I guess a little gray background showing me where I would be dropping

63
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:27,660
this.

64
00:03:27,660 --> 00:03:30,390
I've also got drag and drop within, I think.

65
00:03:30,390 --> 00:03:30,930
Do I?

66
00:03:31,910 --> 00:03:34,550
Oh, I think I just deleted one, so I'll do that.

67
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:35,950
Let's try this again.

68
00:03:35,960 --> 00:03:36,720
How do I reorder?

69
00:03:36,740 --> 00:03:37,360
There we go.

70
00:03:37,370 --> 00:03:38,840
I can move these around.

71
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:39,800
I can click.

72
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:40,820
That's an event.

73
00:03:41,330 --> 00:03:43,030
Click again to undo.

74
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:48,680
I'm sure there are other events I'm missing, but already we've seen dragging, dropping, hovering,

75
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:50,150
clicking, typing.

76
00:03:50,150 --> 00:03:54,680
All of these are events that we can listen for and there are way more.

77
00:03:54,710 --> 00:03:57,910
This is a small sampling of some of the more common ones.

78
00:03:57,920 --> 00:03:59,330
I've tried to group them.

79
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:02,390
On the left side, we have things that are definitely more common.

80
00:04:02,390 --> 00:04:07,940
On the right side, somewhat common so we can listen for clicks in our JavaScript and run some code.

81
00:04:07,940 --> 00:04:09,890
When somebody clicks, we can do something.

82
00:04:09,890 --> 00:04:14,150
When someone drags or drops or hovers or scrolls, that's a pretty common one.

83
00:04:14,150 --> 00:04:18,829
When you scroll on a web page, sometimes there will be like an animation that triggers when you scroll

84
00:04:18,829 --> 00:04:19,790
to a certain position.

85
00:04:19,790 --> 00:04:25,040
We have events for forms being submitted, key presses, focus and blur.

86
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:32,450
So focus is when you're in an input like this, it's focused right now, and if I click away, it's

87
00:04:32,450 --> 00:04:33,020
blurred.

88
00:04:33,020 --> 00:04:35,510
We can run code in those scenarios.

89
00:04:35,510 --> 00:04:38,900
And actually right there we're seeing that happen live.

90
00:04:38,990 --> 00:04:44,720
If I go to edit it, notice that I get all this stuff over here, I've got this grayed out background

91
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:48,560
and then when the input loses focus, all of that goes away.

92
00:04:48,590 --> 00:04:54,410
So there are some code that says when that input loses focus, when the user clicks away, then hide

93
00:04:54,410 --> 00:04:57,170
all of that extra stuff or change the colors or whatever happened.

94
00:04:57,170 --> 00:04:59,210
We've also got mouse wheel events.

95
00:04:59,210 --> 00:05:04,820
I don't think I've ever worked with one of those, but they are available double click, not as common.

96
00:05:04,820 --> 00:05:06,680
Then we have copying and pasting.

97
00:05:06,950 --> 00:05:12,530
I maybe used them a couple of times, but these allow you to run specific code when a user copy something

98
00:05:12,530 --> 00:05:14,600
or paste something into an input.

99
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:20,780
For example, we have events for when audio starts playing or audio stops playing or when audio initially

100
00:05:20,780 --> 00:05:22,640
loads when it completes its load.

101
00:05:22,640 --> 00:05:26,060
We've got screen resize events, even printing events.

102
00:05:26,060 --> 00:05:30,830
I've never used these, but there are two events, one called before print and after print.

103
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:32,390
I think that's what they're called.

104
00:05:32,390 --> 00:05:38,330
When a user goes to print a website and open up that print dialog before it opens, there's an event

105
00:05:38,330 --> 00:05:44,270
that we can tap into and run code, and after the user clicks the print button, I guess there's another

106
00:05:44,270 --> 00:05:45,770
event that we can listen for.

107
00:05:46,130 --> 00:05:48,500
I've never used them, but they exist.

108
00:05:48,500 --> 00:05:54,380
If you go to MDM, there's a page called Event Reference and this contains all of the different names

109
00:05:54,380 --> 00:05:58,280
of the events in JavaScript that we can work with and they're grouped together.

110
00:05:58,370 --> 00:06:04,160
So we have mouse events when a user clicks or double clicks when they mouse down, which is when you

111
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:11,120
depress the key or depress the mouse button, but you don't have to release versus a click is a click,

112
00:06:11,130 --> 00:06:14,840
a full click down and up we have mouse leave.

113
00:06:14,840 --> 00:06:19,010
So that's when a mouse leaves an element that it was hovering over.

114
00:06:19,640 --> 00:06:21,920
We've also got things for dragging and dropping.

115
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:26,300
You can see there's quite a few drag, drag and drag enter, drag start.

116
00:06:26,300 --> 00:06:31,580
We have things for media not as common, at least in most of the apps that I do.

117
00:06:32,090 --> 00:06:33,800
We have audio.

118
00:06:33,830 --> 00:06:40,280
What do we have play playback has begun on a piece of media is playing when the playback rate has changed,

119
00:06:40,280 --> 00:06:44,330
when a user has seeked forward, when they've skipped forward or backwards.

120
00:06:44,420 --> 00:06:47,420
Volume change events time update.

121
00:06:48,020 --> 00:06:50,120
Okay, I'm not even sure what that one does.

122
00:06:50,150 --> 00:06:53,630
The time indicated by current time attribute has been updated.

123
00:06:54,020 --> 00:06:54,410
All right.

124
00:06:54,410 --> 00:06:56,000
I'm sure there's a use for that.

125
00:06:56,570 --> 00:07:03,590
We have things like progress events, storage events, update events, value change events.

126
00:07:03,590 --> 00:07:06,260
And further up we've got view events.

127
00:07:06,260 --> 00:07:13,040
When a user goes to full screen mode, scroll events, resizing, printing, which I mentioned, kind

128
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:14,240
of obscure stuff.

129
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:16,280
We've got animation events.

130
00:07:16,280 --> 00:07:22,580
When an animation starts focus and blur network events, there's just so many of them and you're never

131
00:07:22,580 --> 00:07:23,660
going to use all of them.

132
00:07:23,660 --> 00:07:28,640
Well, I'm sure somebody has, but it will be pretty difficult to use all of them.

133
00:07:28,640 --> 00:07:30,590
I'm going to focus on the most important ones.

134
00:07:30,590 --> 00:07:35,480
But the great news is I'm going to show you the pattern you follow where you can use any of these events

135
00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:36,920
with just one method.

136
00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:38,570
It's actually pretty straightforward.

137
00:07:38,660 --> 00:07:42,950
So we've got a lot to talk about here, but it's honestly just one method that we're going to cover

138
00:07:42,950 --> 00:07:44,300
after the very next video.

139
00:07:44,300 --> 00:07:46,430
So I'll see you then in like 5 seconds.

140
00:07:46,430 --> 00:07:48,050
If it auto plays, I'll see you then.
