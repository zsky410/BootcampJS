1
00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:00,660
All right.

2
00:00:00,660 --> 00:00:01,320
Welcome back.

3
00:00:01,350 --> 00:00:05,570
This is part two of our Taste of the Dome little demonstration.

4
00:00:05,580 --> 00:00:09,930
So I'm going to go ahead and play around with Google, the home page of Google again.

5
00:00:09,930 --> 00:00:14,880
But I'm going to do something a little bit more visual, more intense.

6
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:19,980
I'm going to take every element that you see on the screen and animate it around randomly.

7
00:00:19,980 --> 00:00:23,550
So it will just end up being a huge mess to try and use.

8
00:00:23,550 --> 00:00:29,220
And yeah, just to show you that we can do things like change styles and move things around and animate

9
00:00:29,220 --> 00:00:29,670
them.

10
00:00:29,910 --> 00:00:31,710
So I'm going to open up my console.

11
00:00:31,740 --> 00:00:33,180
Oh, almost there.

12
00:00:33,210 --> 00:00:34,310
Command option J.

13
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:35,010
There we go.

14
00:00:35,220 --> 00:00:39,270
And the way I'm going to write my code instead of just typing it in the console because I'm going to

15
00:00:39,270 --> 00:00:43,020
have probably ten or 20 lines, I'm going to make a snippet.

16
00:00:43,020 --> 00:00:49,050
And in Chrome to make a snippet, we go to sources and then there's a tab called snippets.

17
00:00:49,050 --> 00:00:52,880
If it doesn't show up for you, you can click the arrow and go to snippets.

18
00:00:52,890 --> 00:00:56,640
This allows me to write some code, so I'm going to click new snippet.

19
00:00:56,640 --> 00:01:01,920
I can write code and then run it at any point in the browser without having to make a separate file.

20
00:01:02,370 --> 00:01:07,380
And it will be evaluated and I can do things with the current web page, so I'm just going to try something

21
00:01:07,380 --> 00:01:15,630
like console.log two plus two, I'm going to save it and then I can run it either by hitting where's

22
00:01:15,630 --> 00:01:20,790
that button right here, clicking this or using the shortcut, which is what I use.

23
00:01:20,790 --> 00:01:22,380
Command Enter on a mac.

24
00:01:22,380 --> 00:01:24,960
If you're on a PC, it will tell you what to use right there.

25
00:01:25,290 --> 00:01:29,850
So I just ran it and if I look at my console, you can see four was printed out.

26
00:01:29,940 --> 00:01:33,330
So we're not going to be using console plugs or anything right now.

27
00:01:33,330 --> 00:01:36,990
I'm instead going to interact with the elements over here on the DOM.

28
00:01:37,020 --> 00:01:38,220
Get rid of that triangle.

29
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:46,500
Some fun top Google searches How to make French Toast, Jobs, Hiring and funny cat videos.

30
00:01:46,530 --> 00:01:47,760
Can't argue with that.

31
00:01:47,910 --> 00:01:48,270
All right.

32
00:01:48,270 --> 00:01:51,360
So the first thing I'll show you is that we can create new elements.

33
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:52,380
Super easy.

34
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:54,240
Well, it's relatively easy.

35
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:56,550
Don't worry about any of this syntax.

36
00:01:56,550 --> 00:01:58,920
We'll go into the details about how all of this works.

37
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:00,540
But I'm going to make a new image.

38
00:02:00,760 --> 00:02:02,400
I'm going to give it a name.

39
00:02:02,430 --> 00:02:03,630
My image.

40
00:02:04,260 --> 00:02:05,820
I'm going to give it a source.

41
00:02:05,820 --> 00:02:12,990
My image source equals and I have a URL of copied from Unsplash, a free image we can use.

42
00:02:12,990 --> 00:02:17,880
And then I'm going to add this image to the DOM, I'm going to insert it.

43
00:02:17,880 --> 00:02:20,160
So I'll do document body.

44
00:02:21,910 --> 00:02:27,520
Dot append my image and if I run this code, I'll hit command.

45
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:28,120
Enter.

46
00:02:28,760 --> 00:02:30,190
Oh, there's my image.

47
00:02:30,340 --> 00:02:31,720
Very large image.

48
00:02:31,720 --> 00:02:32,970
But it's showing up.

49
00:02:32,980 --> 00:02:40,360
If I want to amend it to be smaller, my image dot style dot width equals let's do 200 pixels.

50
00:02:41,290 --> 00:02:42,570
Run this code again.

51
00:02:42,580 --> 00:02:44,180
I'll have to refresh my page and run it.

52
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:47,080
Now we have this image of a dog wearing goggles.

53
00:02:47,410 --> 00:02:49,220
Okay, so that's the first bit.

54
00:02:49,240 --> 00:02:53,070
Now, if I want to move it around, there's a lot of different ways of doing this.

55
00:02:53,080 --> 00:02:56,650
The best way would be to do it mostly via CSS.

56
00:02:56,920 --> 00:03:02,500
But what I'm going to do is in JavaScript, I'm going to generate some random numbers, an X and a Y

57
00:03:02,530 --> 00:03:10,540
coordinate or a position and use that to move the image to that location using a CSS transform.

58
00:03:10,630 --> 00:03:15,910
So if you haven't seen transforms and CSS, this is going to be new, but it's really just a demo of

59
00:03:15,910 --> 00:03:18,650
like cool stuff we can do, so don't worry about it.

60
00:03:18,670 --> 00:03:25,990
What I'll do is get my image, my image style, dot transform.

61
00:03:26,350 --> 00:03:30,490
And before I animate anything, I'll just assign a transform.

62
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,910
Like, how about translate?

63
00:03:34,210 --> 00:03:38,890
And then I give it a number, like 300, comma, 200.

64
00:03:39,700 --> 00:03:40,660
Let's see how that looks.

65
00:03:40,660 --> 00:03:41,500
If I run it.

66
00:03:42,220 --> 00:03:46,490
Oh, I think I forgot the pixels that I need to add 302 hundred pixels.

67
00:03:46,510 --> 00:03:47,710
Let's try that again.

68
00:03:47,710 --> 00:03:48,250
Okay.

69
00:03:48,250 --> 00:03:50,110
So now I transformed the image.

70
00:03:50,110 --> 00:03:52,090
I moved it over here, I translated it.

71
00:03:52,300 --> 00:03:54,400
So that's how we can do it just once.

72
00:03:54,400 --> 00:04:00,730
Now, if I wanted to do this randomly and I want to repeat it, I could do it using a set interval.

73
00:04:00,880 --> 00:04:05,170
So set interval I pass in my function.

74
00:04:05,500 --> 00:04:08,410
I'll use an arrow function just for some diversity here.

75
00:04:08,830 --> 00:04:12,700
And we also need the duration or how long that interval should be.

76
00:04:12,700 --> 00:04:18,310
So every 2 seconds we'll run this code and we will transform that image.

77
00:04:18,310 --> 00:04:25,360
But let's generate two random pixel values and I'm going to use the dimensions of the screen which I

78
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:27,880
can access using document.

79
00:04:27,880 --> 00:04:29,590
Dot body.

80
00:04:29,590 --> 00:04:30,880
Dot client.

81
00:04:31,780 --> 00:04:34,420
Width and height, height.

82
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:38,620
So that's something we will see and talk about in greater detail.

83
00:04:39,490 --> 00:04:40,540
Document dot.

84
00:04:40,570 --> 00:04:41,890
Body dot.

85
00:04:41,890 --> 00:04:45,040
Client width times.

86
00:04:45,790 --> 00:04:47,110
Map random.

87
00:04:47,140 --> 00:04:52,390
Make sure I add my friends and then I'll floor that whole thing as we've seen before to get a whole

88
00:04:52,390 --> 00:04:53,050
number.

89
00:04:53,110 --> 00:04:59,920
So this will give me a random number between zero and whatever the width of the window is, which changes

90
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:01,790
depending on the actual width.

91
00:05:01,810 --> 00:05:06,220
So here we get a different width versus here we would be getting 400 pixels.

92
00:05:06,670 --> 00:05:07,090
All right.

93
00:05:07,150 --> 00:05:13,060
So messed up for I'm going to save that to a variable called X and then duplicate this and do the same

94
00:05:13,060 --> 00:05:15,050
thing for a variable called Y.

95
00:05:15,070 --> 00:05:19,010
I'm just getting two random numbers mapped out for document dot body.

96
00:05:19,030 --> 00:05:25,450
I'm going to do client height here and then I'm going to plug those numbers in right here.

97
00:05:26,510 --> 00:05:30,950
So this does need to be a template literal, not single quotes.

98
00:05:30,950 --> 00:05:39,680
So I'll put that around my string and then interpolate x pixels and then y pixels and the moment of

99
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:40,310
truth.

100
00:05:40,970 --> 00:05:42,020
Let's see what happens.

101
00:05:42,020 --> 00:05:44,210
Okay, we're getting something.

102
00:05:44,210 --> 00:05:46,250
It's not pretty, it's very jerky.

103
00:05:46,250 --> 00:05:48,620
But every 2 seconds it is moving around.

104
00:05:49,250 --> 00:05:54,800
And if I wanted to make it smoother in my case, I would add in a transition property.

105
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:57,320
Although right now I don't have a CSS stylesheet.

106
00:05:57,320 --> 00:06:02,210
This is Google's website, so I'll just show you that you can do it through JavaScript.

107
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:04,220
My image dot style.

108
00:06:04,250 --> 00:06:05,630
Dot transition.

109
00:06:06,950 --> 00:06:07,790
Equals.

110
00:06:07,790 --> 00:06:09,650
And then I'll say one.

111
00:06:09,860 --> 00:06:10,520
What is it all?

112
00:06:10,520 --> 00:06:11,120
1/2.

113
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:12,230
Let's do 2 seconds.

114
00:06:12,230 --> 00:06:16,310
If this interval is 2 seconds, I'll have it take 2 seconds to translate.

115
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:17,820
And does it work?

116
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:19,010
Ooh, look at that.

117
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:20,870
It's moving all over the place.

118
00:06:21,230 --> 00:06:22,910
Okay, so kind of fun.

119
00:06:22,910 --> 00:06:27,320
We're picking a random X and Y on the screen and moving the image.

120
00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:30,350
That image, for the record, was not there when the page loaded.

121
00:06:30,350 --> 00:06:34,490
We're adding it in, so we're seeing a whole bunch of different features already.

122
00:06:34,490 --> 00:06:36,260
We created a new element.

123
00:06:36,260 --> 00:06:41,590
We updated its source attribute, we added it to the page, then we added some CSS to it.

124
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:43,370
We changed the width to make it smaller.

125
00:06:43,370 --> 00:06:49,730
We change the transition property to make it smoother when it moves, and then in a interval we're picking

126
00:06:49,730 --> 00:06:56,160
random numbers and using that to generate a translation, a transform across the screen every 2 seconds.

127
00:06:56,180 --> 00:07:00,680
Now for the extra fun part, let's do it to every single thing on the page.

128
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:02,150
So this same logic.

129
00:07:02,150 --> 00:07:06,260
But I want it to happen for every element and there's a lot of ways of doing this.

130
00:07:06,260 --> 00:07:14,750
What I'm going to do is select all the elements using this document dot body, dot children.

131
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:20,300
Again, this is getting to stuff where you have not seen we haven't seen any of this, so please don't

132
00:07:20,300 --> 00:07:20,900
worry about it.

133
00:07:20,900 --> 00:07:25,910
We will get to every every single line of code we're writing here will have at least a video addressing

134
00:07:25,910 --> 00:07:27,230
it and how it works.

135
00:07:27,380 --> 00:07:31,640
So Document Dot Body Children will give me all the elements that we're seeing on the page.

136
00:07:32,090 --> 00:07:36,860
I don't want to select every element in the DOM because there are elements like script tags and link

137
00:07:36,860 --> 00:07:38,360
tags and the title tag.

138
00:07:38,360 --> 00:07:39,410
We don't want those.

139
00:07:39,410 --> 00:07:41,270
We want just the stuff showing up.

140
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:43,460
So document body children.

141
00:07:43,460 --> 00:07:45,680
I'll just call this all ls.

142
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:52,760
All elements, and then I'm going to loop over all elements inside of my interval.

143
00:07:53,030 --> 00:08:00,680
So for let L of all L's, I'm going to pick an X and a Y.

144
00:08:02,730 --> 00:08:09,660
I'm going to use that X and Y to update the transition excuse me, the transform of that element.

145
00:08:09,660 --> 00:08:11,880
So let me make this easier to see.

146
00:08:13,350 --> 00:08:16,320
Instead of my image style, I'm going to do L.

147
00:08:16,380 --> 00:08:21,600
So I select everything on the page, and then for each one I'm going to give it a new transform with

148
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:26,970
a new random x and y, and we'll do it every 2000 seconds or 2000 milliseconds.

149
00:08:26,970 --> 00:08:29,640
We'd be here quite a long time if I did it to everyone.

150
00:08:29,670 --> 00:08:30,420
Whoops.

151
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:31,830
All right, let's go back.

152
00:08:31,830 --> 00:08:32,520
Try it again.

153
00:08:32,520 --> 00:08:33,539
Run my code.

154
00:08:34,380 --> 00:08:35,610
Fingers crossed.

155
00:08:35,610 --> 00:08:40,320
All right, so we only have the dog image that is transitioning smoothly.

156
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:42,480
Everything else is just jerking around.

157
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:46,470
Let's also rotate everything so we could pick a random rotation here.

158
00:08:46,470 --> 00:08:52,110
We'll call this rotation, which needs to be a number between zero and 360.

159
00:08:52,110 --> 00:08:57,150
So we'll do math random times 360.

160
00:08:57,990 --> 00:09:00,180
That should give us a random rotation.

161
00:09:00,180 --> 00:09:06,630
And then the way that transform works in CSIS is that it wants us to pass in a number of degrees.

162
00:09:07,660 --> 00:09:11,050
So we'll do it just like this dollar sign rotation.

163
00:09:11,050 --> 00:09:15,880
And then afterwards we need to write deg for degrees like we had to do for pixels.

164
00:09:15,880 --> 00:09:18,340
And this should be rotate, not rotation.

165
00:09:18,550 --> 00:09:19,840
Let's try it out.

166
00:09:19,840 --> 00:09:22,610
And there we go.

167
00:09:22,630 --> 00:09:23,650
Things are rotating.

168
00:09:23,650 --> 00:09:26,440
They're just not animated except for our one image.

169
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:30,700
So the last thing we'll do is apply a style to everything in the body.

170
00:09:30,700 --> 00:09:35,320
We'll add a new part to the style sheet and I'll just paste the code in for that.

171
00:09:35,590 --> 00:09:39,550
Here, what I'm saying is make a new CSS style sheet.

172
00:09:39,700 --> 00:09:41,170
Basically, that's what I'm saying.

173
00:09:41,170 --> 00:09:49,510
And then add in a new selector, select everything via CSS, give it transition of 2 seconds and then

174
00:09:49,510 --> 00:09:52,210
I'll add that stylesheet in again.

175
00:09:52,210 --> 00:09:56,500
Don't worry about any of this code whatsoever, but let's just see if it works.

176
00:09:56,770 --> 00:09:57,700
I'm going to run it.

177
00:09:57,880 --> 00:09:59,050
Fingers crossed.

178
00:09:59,050 --> 00:10:00,400
Hey, look at that.

179
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:02,800
Everything's all rotating and going crazy.

180
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:05,150
Moving across the page.

181
00:10:07,450 --> 00:10:11,740
It is kind of annoying that this whole thing is treated as one element.

182
00:10:11,770 --> 00:10:14,680
This, I think, is called viewport is the element.

183
00:10:14,680 --> 00:10:16,960
So we might be able to break that up a bit.

184
00:10:17,620 --> 00:10:24,160
But you can see what I'm trying to show you is that we can select things, we can screw with them in

185
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:29,440
maybe not so nice ways like animating them, but these principles apply for everything we would do.

186
00:10:29,590 --> 00:10:35,410
We can interact with the form, get the value out, or change an image source to make a slideshow widget.

187
00:10:35,890 --> 00:10:38,440
We can add events like we saw in the last video.

188
00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:43,330
We can pick random things and mess with them with random numbers and transformations.

189
00:10:43,480 --> 00:10:45,790
Maybe not all that often, but you can do that.

190
00:10:45,790 --> 00:10:49,900
We can add new styles to a stylesheet, we can make things have a transition.

191
00:10:49,900 --> 00:10:52,780
We can create an image out of nowhere and add it to the page.

192
00:10:53,140 --> 00:10:55,780
So I tweaked it ever so slightly before.

193
00:10:55,780 --> 00:11:02,050
What was happening is I was getting every element in the body, which is really just this one div and

194
00:11:02,050 --> 00:11:03,130
it contains everything.

195
00:11:03,130 --> 00:11:07,870
And I was animating this one div, so this whole piece of content was animating together.

196
00:11:07,870 --> 00:11:13,960
But now what I've done is updated it so that I'm animating these elements inside that div instead,

197
00:11:14,080 --> 00:11:15,700
which you can see here.

198
00:11:15,910 --> 00:11:17,590
This is what this line does.

199
00:11:17,590 --> 00:11:23,710
If I run it now, we end up with some independent rotation and moving around anyways.

200
00:11:23,710 --> 00:11:30,490
The whole thing is useless and silly, but it illustrates this idea of changing objects and seeing those

201
00:11:30,490 --> 00:11:33,010
changes reflected in the actual browser.

202
00:11:33,010 --> 00:11:39,190
So everything we've done has been manipulating JavaScript objects, hence the object model part of the

203
00:11:39,190 --> 00:11:39,730
DOM.

204
00:11:39,910 --> 00:11:42,340
So really, really important idea behind all of this.

205
00:11:42,340 --> 00:11:50,200
The page loads and all of that juicy content is run through the DOM machine, the DOM Maker 3000, obviously

206
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:55,120
not what it's called, but it takes that content, it understands it digests it, and it spits out a

207
00:11:55,120 --> 00:12:00,400
bunch of JavaScript objects, some of which we interacted with in order to make this happen, and some

208
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:06,070
of which we created from scratch, and then told the DOM or told JavaScript to insert them with the

209
00:12:06,070 --> 00:12:07,120
rest of the content.

210
00:12:07,690 --> 00:12:08,230
Okay.

211
00:12:08,230 --> 00:12:13,690
So now that we've had a somewhat overwhelming taste of the DOM, now we're going to go into the basics

212
00:12:13,690 --> 00:12:14,920
and start from the beginning.

213
00:12:14,920 --> 00:12:16,990
How do we do some of the stuff we just did?

214
00:12:17,410 --> 00:12:22,450
We'll go into detail around selecting and changing styles and different attributes and events.

215
00:12:22,450 --> 00:12:23,530
There's a lot to talk about.
