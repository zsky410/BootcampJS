1
00:00:00,090 --> 00:00:01,140
Before we move on.

2
00:00:01,140 --> 00:00:05,850
There are some prerequisites, some things that you need to be comfortable with before you can really

3
00:00:05,850 --> 00:00:08,610
master the DOM before this content will make sense to you.

4
00:00:09,210 --> 00:00:12,720
Those topics are basic HTML and CSS.

5
00:00:13,020 --> 00:00:18,240
The good news is that HTML and CSS are really pretty easy to learn the basics of.

6
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:21,150
At least we're not talking about making beautiful websites.

7
00:00:21,150 --> 00:00:24,750
We're not talking about crazy complex layouts that are responsive.

8
00:00:24,870 --> 00:00:29,970
You just need to understand how to create simple elements on a page, how to nest things together,

9
00:00:29,970 --> 00:00:36,930
how to work with IDs and classes, how to write simple CSS selectors to select based off of elements

10
00:00:36,930 --> 00:00:38,610
in classes and IDs.

11
00:00:38,610 --> 00:00:40,140
Maybe attributes.

12
00:00:40,140 --> 00:00:46,620
You need to understand how to change colors with CSS and fonts and how to resize something the basic

13
00:00:46,620 --> 00:00:47,340
properties.

14
00:00:47,340 --> 00:00:53,400
So if you don't have that understanding right now, I recommend you take an hour or two to go follow

15
00:00:53,400 --> 00:00:54,710
a tutorial online.

16
00:00:54,720 --> 00:00:56,160
You can check out my YouTube channel.

17
00:00:56,160 --> 00:01:02,790
I have a basic HTML and CSS intro, but there are also tons of great courses paid and free and books

18
00:01:03,150 --> 00:01:04,680
and free blog posts.

19
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:08,940
You don't need to go buy an expensive course or even buy anything.

20
00:01:08,940 --> 00:01:14,550
Just take some time and set it aside so that this section in the next few sections actually make sense

21
00:01:14,550 --> 00:01:15,030
to you.

22
00:01:15,120 --> 00:01:17,910
Because this stuff is really exciting, it's fun.

23
00:01:17,910 --> 00:01:23,970
But if you don't have that understanding of HTML and CSS, it's just going to be intimidating and make

24
00:01:23,970 --> 00:01:28,980
it a lot more challenging than it needs to be because this Dom stuff is actually not hard.

25
00:01:28,980 --> 00:01:34,440
Where it gets tricky is when people try and learn it before they understand HTML and CSS.

26
00:01:34,590 --> 00:01:41,070
So I'm going to do a little demo slash assessment that you can self assess based off of.

27
00:01:41,070 --> 00:01:46,260
I'm going to write some simple HTML and CSS to show you the level of understanding I'm looking for.

28
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:49,290
So I have an HTML file already created.

29
00:01:49,290 --> 00:01:51,720
I'm going to add some simple elements in here.

30
00:01:51,750 --> 00:01:55,350
We'll add an H one and this will say my web page.

31
00:01:55,920 --> 00:02:01,140
I'm going to add a simple ul an unordered list with a couple of allies.

32
00:02:01,140 --> 00:02:05,640
First thing, second thing and third thing.

33
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:09,479
So I have an ally here or three lies in an unordered list.

34
00:02:09,479 --> 00:02:11,130
I'm going to add an image.

35
00:02:11,130 --> 00:02:17,190
I'll set the source to be this nice grizzly bear image from Unsplash.com nice images that we can use

36
00:02:17,190 --> 00:02:17,850
for free.

37
00:02:18,780 --> 00:02:24,660
And I will also go ahead and add in maybe a paragraph tag or two paragraphs.

38
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:31,320
Just let's do some lorem ipsum so I can just type lorem in vs code and then I'll add another one of

39
00:02:31,320 --> 00:02:34,560
those lorem just random text.

40
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:39,600
I'll add an ID to my image and I'll call this image.

41
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:41,580
We'll just call it Beyer photo.

42
00:02:43,570 --> 00:02:48,250
So if you're still with me, if this is all making sense and feels like very basic stuff, that's good

43
00:02:48,250 --> 00:02:48,730
news.

44
00:02:48,730 --> 00:02:52,000
If any of this is confusing, you're not sure what these elements are.

45
00:02:52,040 --> 00:02:54,520
You don't know what an ID is or a source.

46
00:02:54,550 --> 00:02:55,460
Take some time.

47
00:02:55,480 --> 00:02:57,960
Go learn that stuff because you'll need it.

48
00:02:57,970 --> 00:03:03,040
You absolutely need it for the next couple of sections, and I don't want you to feel bad or get lost.

49
00:03:03,070 --> 00:03:04,540
All right, so we have our H one.

50
00:03:04,570 --> 00:03:07,000
I'll also add a class to my Liz.

51
00:03:07,030 --> 00:03:11,650
Two of them, at least this class will be called special.

52
00:03:13,050 --> 00:03:13,650
Okay.

53
00:03:13,950 --> 00:03:15,540
So I have two paragraphs.

54
00:03:15,540 --> 00:03:19,350
I have my H one, I have allies that have a class of special.

55
00:03:19,350 --> 00:03:23,520
I have an ally that doesn't and I have an idea for my image of bear photo.

56
00:03:23,850 --> 00:03:27,840
Now I'm going to make a stylesheet, so I'll just make my file here.

57
00:03:27,870 --> 00:03:36,630
I'll call it CSS and I'm going to start by styling my H one, just something simple color purple font

58
00:03:36,630 --> 00:03:38,310
size 20.

59
00:03:38,460 --> 00:03:39,420
Now that's going to be very small.

60
00:03:39,420 --> 00:03:41,100
How about 60 pixels?

61
00:03:41,550 --> 00:03:45,630
So I haven't connected my stylesheet, but let's just make sure my content is showing up.

62
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:46,770
All right?

63
00:03:46,770 --> 00:03:56,250
Now I'll connect my stylesheet using a link tag and the ref is app dot css and my h one should change.

64
00:03:56,250 --> 00:03:58,050
It's purple now and larger.

65
00:03:58,320 --> 00:04:01,050
So if this syntax is new to you, you haven't seen it.

66
00:04:01,050 --> 00:04:03,450
You don't know what font size does or color.

67
00:04:03,510 --> 00:04:08,760
I guess that's pretty self explanatory, but if you're not sure about this syntax here, then take some

68
00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:09,870
time and review that.

69
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:14,130
Let's also go and select the bear image.

70
00:04:14,130 --> 00:04:16,740
So here's the first little part of the assessment.

71
00:04:16,740 --> 00:04:23,130
How would we style this bear image to give it a width of 250 pixels using the ID?

72
00:04:23,950 --> 00:04:24,670
All right.

73
00:04:24,700 --> 00:04:32,440
So I'm going to come in here and select it with bare dash image and I need to make sure I add in a bear

74
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:33,010
photo.

75
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:33,720
Oh, geez.

76
00:04:33,730 --> 00:04:34,400
Horrible name.

77
00:04:34,420 --> 00:04:35,560
Can't even remember it.

78
00:04:35,740 --> 00:04:41,650
I need to make sure I add in my hash symbol there to make it clear it's an ID and I'll give it a width

79
00:04:41,980 --> 00:04:44,050
of 250 pixels.

80
00:04:44,860 --> 00:04:46,090
Refresh my page.

81
00:04:46,510 --> 00:04:47,860
Much more manageable.

82
00:04:48,640 --> 00:04:53,260
The next part of the assessment, I'd like for you to make the class of special.

83
00:04:53,260 --> 00:04:54,560
These two lies.

84
00:04:54,580 --> 00:05:01,690
I'd like them to be teal and 30 pixels, font size and give them a one pixel border.

85
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:02,770
Also teal.

86
00:05:03,580 --> 00:05:06,640
So we'll select the class, which was called special.

87
00:05:06,940 --> 00:05:09,910
I need to use the dot because it's a class.

88
00:05:10,610 --> 00:05:12,980
And I'm going to start with color.

89
00:05:13,070 --> 00:05:13,670
What did I say?

90
00:05:13,700 --> 00:05:14,360
Teal.

91
00:05:14,780 --> 00:05:16,460
And then font size.

92
00:05:16,850 --> 00:05:21,650
I think I said 30 pixels and border was one pixel teal.

93
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:24,240
Let's see what we get.

94
00:05:24,570 --> 00:05:27,660
All right, so there is my special class.

95
00:05:27,870 --> 00:05:33,600
So I've styled the H one, the image with the idea of bear photo and the two items.

96
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:36,060
The two eyes that have a class of special.

97
00:05:36,540 --> 00:05:37,490
It looks horrendous.

98
00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:38,490
It's very gross.

99
00:05:38,490 --> 00:05:40,440
But this stuff is very important.

100
00:05:40,470 --> 00:05:42,000
Don't worry about the styles.

101
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:46,890
But if you feel like any of this was new or confusing, you need some clarity on it.

102
00:05:46,920 --> 00:05:49,800
Go look online and get some practice.

103
00:05:49,830 --> 00:05:53,610
Now, here's one more thing that you could use as a little assessment.

104
00:05:53,730 --> 00:05:55,890
Let's add in a form.

105
00:05:56,250 --> 00:06:00,420
All right, so I'll add a form element right here.

106
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:05,810
And in this form I'm going to add an input type equals text.

107
00:06:06,140 --> 00:06:10,910
I'd like to give it a placeholder of what should we do?

108
00:06:11,540 --> 00:06:16,850
Bear name and then another input below that.

109
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:20,840
And instead of type equals text, what are our options here?

110
00:06:20,840 --> 00:06:22,520
We'll do type equals.

111
00:06:23,030 --> 00:06:25,670
How about password?

112
00:06:27,410 --> 00:06:29,210
And then give it a placeholder.

113
00:06:30,740 --> 00:06:31,820
Of password.

114
00:06:33,590 --> 00:06:37,400
And then one more input we'll do type equals submit.

115
00:06:39,220 --> 00:06:41,440
Well, refresh and we have our form here.

116
00:06:41,860 --> 00:06:49,610
What I'd like you to do is select only the input that has type of password and give it a different width.

117
00:06:49,630 --> 00:06:51,960
You can change it to smaller, larger.

118
00:06:51,970 --> 00:06:53,830
Just give it a different width and height.

119
00:06:54,460 --> 00:06:58,730
So you'll have to select based off of the type, not off of input.

120
00:06:58,750 --> 00:07:00,880
Don't add an ID, don't add a class.

121
00:07:00,970 --> 00:07:02,470
Select it as is.

122
00:07:03,270 --> 00:07:04,990
So I'm going to do that over here.

123
00:07:05,010 --> 00:07:09,420
If I just did input like I did for H one, that will target all three.

124
00:07:09,420 --> 00:07:16,560
And if I do height, let's do 50 pixels with 100 pixels.

125
00:07:18,450 --> 00:07:19,410
That does work.

126
00:07:19,410 --> 00:07:27,720
But I only want to target this one right here so I can add in an attribute selector type equals password.

127
00:07:29,730 --> 00:07:32,020
And now only this one is affected.

128
00:07:32,040 --> 00:07:34,080
The other inputs are unchanged.

129
00:07:34,440 --> 00:07:36,450
So that's it for the stuff.

130
00:07:36,450 --> 00:07:41,400
I mean, that's not everything you need to know, but that's a general sampling of the kind of HTML

131
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:43,240
and CSS experience you need.

132
00:07:43,260 --> 00:07:51,000
You need to be able to do basic styles, understand CSS syntax, key value pairs, semicolons, selecting

133
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:54,580
based off of classes, ids, elements, attributes.

134
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:59,670
There's a bunch of other selectors and we may come across some of them in the course, but this is most

135
00:07:59,670 --> 00:08:02,580
of what we'll be selecting based off of in our JavaScript.

136
00:08:02,730 --> 00:08:08,820
And then as far as elements, things like inputs, definitely paragraph tags, H once all the headings,

137
00:08:08,820 --> 00:08:16,290
buttons, list items, all the different text elements, paragraphs, semantic elements like block quotes,

138
00:08:16,290 --> 00:08:17,760
sections, articles.

139
00:08:17,940 --> 00:08:19,980
You don't have to be an expert in everything.

140
00:08:19,980 --> 00:08:25,920
Just I want you to be comfortable enough where you're not focused on the HTML and CSS so much and trying

141
00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:29,550
to understand it that you're missing out on the DOM stuff, which is fun.

142
00:08:30,090 --> 00:08:30,660
All right.

143
00:08:30,660 --> 00:08:33,270
So now we're going to move on to the DOM again.

144
00:08:33,270 --> 00:08:35,039
Please take this seriously.

145
00:08:35,039 --> 00:08:39,000
I mean, you're obviously able to make your own decision and do what you think is best.

146
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:44,580
And if you want to just plow ahead without HTML, CSS experience, it's definitely possible you'll pick

147
00:08:44,580 --> 00:08:45,510
it all up at once.

148
00:08:45,510 --> 00:08:51,000
But for the best experience, I recommend that you you get some practice first, take some time away

149
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:51,980
for just a bit.

150
00:08:51,990 --> 00:08:53,450
You're not going to miss out too much.

151
00:08:53,460 --> 00:08:55,200
The course will still be here for you.

152
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:58,620
Get better with HTML, CSS and then come back.

153
00:08:58,950 --> 00:09:00,930
All right, so let's get going.
