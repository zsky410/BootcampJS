1
00:00:00,090 --> 00:00:02,710
Next up, a third way of selecting.

2
00:00:02,730 --> 00:00:06,270
Not by ID, not by tag name, but by class name.

3
00:00:06,360 --> 00:00:11,700
So we use a lot of classes traditionally in our markup so we can style them with CSS.

4
00:00:11,850 --> 00:00:17,460
And if we want to select based off of those classes, we have a special method to do just that.

5
00:00:17,490 --> 00:00:20,360
Document dot get elements.

6
00:00:20,370 --> 00:00:25,320
It's plural again not singular like id get elements by class name.

7
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:26,430
And that s right there.

8
00:00:26,430 --> 00:00:32,400
The plural sized s on elements tells us that we'll get a collection back, we'll get multiple elements,

9
00:00:32,400 --> 00:00:37,950
or we could get one element, but it will be in a collection just like we had in the last video.

10
00:00:38,460 --> 00:00:40,470
So what classes do I have?

11
00:00:40,740 --> 00:00:48,180
I've got a class called Special on two Liz So I could use that and I think that's the only class I have.

12
00:00:48,450 --> 00:00:51,390
Maybe I'll add something to my h one here.

13
00:00:51,390 --> 00:00:53,910
Let's go with class equals header.

14
00:00:55,380 --> 00:00:55,910
Okay.

15
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:59,310
And I will refresh my page to get that change.

16
00:00:59,370 --> 00:01:03,510
Now if I run document get elements by class name of header.

17
00:01:04,860 --> 00:01:08,520
We get that each one notice it's in an HTML collection.

18
00:01:08,520 --> 00:01:11,070
Once again, another array imposter.

19
00:01:11,220 --> 00:01:14,520
It looks like an array, but we don't get any of those array methods.

20
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:16,530
We could also select multiple.

21
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:20,160
So we have this class called special.

22
00:01:20,490 --> 00:01:22,380
If we select using that class name.

23
00:01:23,050 --> 00:01:24,520
We get two elements.

24
00:01:24,520 --> 00:01:31,240
Each one, once again is an object, has a bunch of stuff in it, and if I select something that is

25
00:01:31,240 --> 00:01:36,400
not found like the class name of chickens, nothing has that class name.

26
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:40,720
We get an empty collection if I try and select based off of an ID.

27
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:43,300
We had an ID called What Do We Have?

28
00:01:43,300 --> 00:01:45,400
Main It's not going to work.

29
00:01:45,910 --> 00:01:47,920
There's nothing with the class name of Main.

30
00:01:47,950 --> 00:01:52,870
There's something with the idea of Main, different methods, different goals, and that's pretty much

31
00:01:52,870 --> 00:01:53,050
it.

32
00:01:53,080 --> 00:01:54,040
Get elements by class.

33
00:01:54,040 --> 00:01:55,840
Name does what it sounds like.

34
00:01:56,350 --> 00:02:01,960
It's very similar to get elements by tag name, except it uses a different criteria tag name versus

35
00:02:01,960 --> 00:02:02,530
class name.

36
00:02:02,530 --> 00:02:04,930
We can iterate over it using a for loop.

37
00:02:05,230 --> 00:02:07,600
You could use a regular for loop a for of loop.

38
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:09,340
One last thing I'll show you.

39
00:02:09,550 --> 00:02:14,800
It has to do with all of the methods we've seen so far is that you don't have to call them only on the

40
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:15,520
document.

41
00:02:15,640 --> 00:02:22,540
If I had a very complex document, let's say, with like thousands and thousands of elements, if I

42
00:02:22,540 --> 00:02:28,600
wanted to select one element and then further search within that one element, I could do that.

43
00:02:28,750 --> 00:02:30,280
So here's an example.

44
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:34,990
Let's say I have the class of special somewhere else on my page.

45
00:02:36,130 --> 00:02:37,090
Let's do it.

46
00:02:37,090 --> 00:02:37,480
I don't know.

47
00:02:37,480 --> 00:02:38,500
I'll just put it here.

48
00:02:38,980 --> 00:02:44,860
I'll make a paragraph with the class of special and just put some stuff in there.

49
00:02:45,700 --> 00:02:50,740
Refresh my page if I want to search for elements with the class of special.

50
00:02:51,010 --> 00:02:55,690
If I do document, get elements by class, name special, I'm getting all three.

51
00:02:56,110 --> 00:03:05,170
If I only want to get the element with that class inside of this UL, I can first select the UL so I

52
00:03:05,170 --> 00:03:15,970
can do that with get elements by tag name, get element by tag name and I want UL that gives me a list.

53
00:03:16,300 --> 00:03:21,820
So I'm going to take the first one from that collection and save it to a variable called UL.

54
00:03:22,060 --> 00:03:30,820
So now I have this variable UL, which is an object and it has its own copy of Get Elements by class

55
00:03:30,820 --> 00:03:37,300
name or tag name so I could search within this UL and pass in special.

56
00:03:39,100 --> 00:03:44,530
And now I only get those two lies that have the class of special because I narrowed it down.

57
00:03:44,530 --> 00:03:51,160
I narrowed my search first to the UL, I stored it in a variable and then I searched for special as

58
00:03:51,160 --> 00:03:54,670
a class within that UL versus earlier.

59
00:03:54,670 --> 00:04:01,360
I looked for all elements in the document with that class and I got three so I could mix it up and use

60
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:04,060
tag name again instead of the UL ul.

61
00:04:04,270 --> 00:04:13,150
Get elements by tag name and then pass in ly and I get the same thing.

62
00:04:13,150 --> 00:04:16,269
And now I get three elements because there are three lies.

63
00:04:16,269 --> 00:04:20,589
I'm not using class, I'm looking for any lie in the UL.

64
00:04:20,709 --> 00:04:26,470
One very important note here is that get element by ID does not work this way because IDs are supposed

65
00:04:26,470 --> 00:04:28,990
to be unique across the entire document.

66
00:04:28,990 --> 00:04:32,650
There should only be one element with whatever id bear photo.

67
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:36,370
There's no functionality to search within another element.

68
00:04:36,850 --> 00:04:37,720
You don't need that.

69
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:40,000
You just search based off of the entire document.

70
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:49,510
So we don't have access to UL get element by ID, we only have well, a mistyped ID if I type get element,

71
00:04:49,540 --> 00:04:52,450
you can see get elements by class name and by tag name.

72
00:04:52,450 --> 00:04:54,070
We don't have ID.

73
00:04:54,490 --> 00:04:55,030
All right.

74
00:04:55,030 --> 00:04:56,470
So you can winnow it down like that.

75
00:04:56,470 --> 00:05:01,540
You can find one element, save it to a variable search within that if you need to.

76
00:05:01,960 --> 00:05:07,540
And that's it for these three basic ways of selecting get element by ID, get elements by class name,

77
00:05:07,540 --> 00:05:08,980
get elements by tag name.

78
00:05:08,980 --> 00:05:14,800
Next, we're going to see a whole new way of doing it, a little bit of an improvement, a nicer way

79
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:17,140
of selecting where you only need one method.
