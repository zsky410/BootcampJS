1
00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:00,570
Hey.

2
00:00:00,570 --> 00:00:01,410
Welcome, everyone.

3
00:00:01,410 --> 00:00:06,750
We've made it to my very favorite topic in the course and honestly, my favorite topic in all of teaching

4
00:00:06,750 --> 00:00:08,430
web development, the DOM.

5
00:00:08,640 --> 00:00:11,010
So this is very exciting stuff in my opinion.

6
00:00:11,010 --> 00:00:15,750
I look forward to it every time I teach and when I teach bootcamps in person, it's my favorite week,

7
00:00:15,750 --> 00:00:16,950
favorite two weeks.

8
00:00:16,950 --> 00:00:23,040
It's really fun stuff because we start to connect JavaScript with HTML and CSS.

9
00:00:23,040 --> 00:00:29,190
This is where I think JavaScript starts to become a lot more exciting and certainly more visual.

10
00:00:29,190 --> 00:00:34,830
You can start to make things with interfaces, things that you can see enough with the contact logging.

11
00:00:34,830 --> 00:00:36,480
So I always look forward to it.

12
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:40,260
Hopefully you're excited about it, especially if you've never worked with the DOM.

13
00:00:40,260 --> 00:00:41,490
You don't know what it is.

14
00:00:41,490 --> 00:00:43,110
There's a lot to cover here.

15
00:00:43,110 --> 00:00:44,580
It won't fit into one section.

16
00:00:44,580 --> 00:00:46,080
We have multiple sections.

17
00:00:46,080 --> 00:00:51,120
I have a couple of examples I'd like to show of things that we could build after you learn how to manipulate

18
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:52,440
and work with the DOM.

19
00:00:53,070 --> 00:00:58,620
So there are some simple ones like here's a form where as I start typing, notice the placeholder text

20
00:00:58,620 --> 00:01:00,000
here that says last name.

21
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:07,680
If I put something in here like Chaplin, notice how the text went down below as a label, and then

22
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:09,540
if I delete it, it goes back up.

23
00:01:09,750 --> 00:01:12,990
Very simple, little tiny touch, but that's done with JavaScript.

24
00:01:12,990 --> 00:01:16,350
So we have the form that is just HTML and CSS.

25
00:01:16,350 --> 00:01:18,600
We don't need JavaScript to make that work.

26
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:21,600
If I comment the JavaScript out, well, I just deleted it.

27
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:22,620
Let's comment it out.

28
00:01:23,130 --> 00:01:27,450
We still have the form here, but now we're not getting that interactive element.

29
00:01:27,660 --> 00:01:30,270
It still looks the same, but we don't get that behavior.

30
00:01:30,510 --> 00:01:31,590
Here's another example.

31
00:01:31,590 --> 00:01:32,670
This is a fun.

32
00:01:32,670 --> 00:01:34,200
Well, fun is relative.

33
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:39,480
It's a game that is a memory game where you have to match different cards and flip them over.

34
00:01:39,480 --> 00:01:43,320
I'm terrible at it, but I really like the interface at the beginning.

35
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:51,000
When you start, you get this nice little flip of the card when you click instructions, and then you

36
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:54,690
can click here to actually begin the game and select a level.

37
00:01:54,990 --> 00:01:57,870
So the content itself is HTML and CSS.

38
00:01:57,870 --> 00:02:03,600
If I comment all of that out, select it, commented out, we still have the exact same interface.

39
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:04,830
It just doesn't do anything.

40
00:02:04,830 --> 00:02:05,700
I'm clicking.

41
00:02:05,910 --> 00:02:09,449
Maybe you can hear that through the mic, but we don't get any behavior.

42
00:02:09,449 --> 00:02:10,949
We're just seeing that content.

43
00:02:10,949 --> 00:02:16,590
It's basically static little blocks of color with some letters, but we add JavaScript in and now they

44
00:02:16,590 --> 00:02:17,250
do something.

45
00:02:17,250 --> 00:02:21,570
When I click and I can play the game, go to casual.

46
00:02:21,630 --> 00:02:26,340
Like I said, I'm horrible at this game, but the just very active clicking on something and having

47
00:02:26,340 --> 00:02:32,430
it change in any way, changing the color, having it flip, revealing the symbol that is all JavaScript.

48
00:02:32,430 --> 00:02:35,160
The cards themselves are HTML and CSS.

49
00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:38,340
It's very hard for me to even attempt to play this while talking.

50
00:02:38,340 --> 00:02:41,640
So I'm already terrible to begin with.

51
00:02:41,730 --> 00:02:44,970
But as you can see, we've also got this timer going across the top.

52
00:02:44,970 --> 00:02:46,170
Highly stressful.

53
00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:51,090
I'm just clicking randomly at this point and one more match before the end.

54
00:02:51,090 --> 00:02:51,660
All right.

55
00:02:52,020 --> 00:02:54,960
So again, this is all JavaScript functionality.

56
00:02:54,960 --> 00:02:58,440
This is JavaScript that is making the game logic that is checking.

57
00:02:58,440 --> 00:03:00,360
If we get a match, it's checking.

58
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:07,530
Oh, geez, it's checking to see if a card has already been clicked on or if the timer has finished,

59
00:03:07,530 --> 00:03:09,960
if you still can play or if it's game over.

60
00:03:10,290 --> 00:03:11,640
Here's another example.

61
00:03:12,060 --> 00:03:19,170
This is another nice form where we have different steps of the form, little animations that are triggered.

62
00:03:19,170 --> 00:03:21,480
So we go from step one to step three.

63
00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:24,810
Each time I click, I'm just seeing HTML and CSS.

64
00:03:24,810 --> 00:03:29,160
If I remove all JavaScript one more time, we still have the exact same content.

65
00:03:29,160 --> 00:03:30,690
It just doesn't do anything.

66
00:03:30,690 --> 00:03:32,760
I can't go from one step to the next.

67
00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:39,390
We add JavaScript in and it's now an interactive, almost like a different set being shown on a stage.

68
00:03:39,390 --> 00:03:44,790
When you go see a musical or a performance, a new set being swapped in and the colors are changing

69
00:03:44,790 --> 00:03:47,250
up here to tell you which step you're on.

70
00:03:47,250 --> 00:03:51,660
So nothing crazy, but this is all done with JavaScript, all the interactivity.

71
00:03:51,810 --> 00:03:55,800
And then now for something a little crazier, much more complex.

72
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:57,300
This is on YouTube.

73
00:03:57,300 --> 00:04:03,750
This is a recorded live stream of a really cool musician, very funny guy, Mike Rabbit.

74
00:04:03,780 --> 00:04:04,980
It doesn't matter who it is.

75
00:04:05,160 --> 00:04:07,800
Anyway, over here we've got comments.

76
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:09,390
Hopefully nothing super inappropriate.

77
00:04:09,390 --> 00:04:15,000
And as I play the the video, you can see these comments start to come in and they're synched to when

78
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:18,480
they were actually submitted back when this was live.

79
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:21,690
I can click to hide, I can show it again.

80
00:04:21,870 --> 00:04:24,600
This is all happening through JavaScript.

81
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:30,840
These elements are being added to the page in conjunction or in time, in sync with this video.

82
00:04:30,900 --> 00:04:32,250
They're being added here.

83
00:04:32,250 --> 00:04:38,190
So even something just like hiding and showing is done with JavaScript, being able to pause video and

84
00:04:38,190 --> 00:04:39,180
have this stop.

85
00:04:39,180 --> 00:04:40,410
We don't get those new comments.

86
00:04:40,410 --> 00:04:42,240
Now that's done with JavaScript.

87
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:46,170
If I fast forward, I get new comments that's done with JavaScript.

88
00:04:46,590 --> 00:04:50,070
So JavaScript, the DOM, very exciting stuff.

89
00:04:50,070 --> 00:04:56,970
This is where we start to take HTML and CSS and control it, update it, or even just read it and understand

90
00:04:56,970 --> 00:04:58,530
it using JavaScript.

91
00:04:58,530 --> 00:04:59,700
So something like this is.

92
00:04:59,730 --> 00:05:06,990
Is made by a team, obviously a huge team at YouTube, but things like a form or a memory game, the

93
00:05:06,990 --> 00:05:08,610
code is really not that bad.

94
00:05:08,610 --> 00:05:14,100
But the thing about the DOM that I'll tell you right now is that you have to use tons and tons of methods

95
00:05:14,100 --> 00:05:16,020
and properties that we haven't seen before.

96
00:05:16,140 --> 00:05:22,350
So remember when we saw arrays or we saw strings and I talked about here's 20 methods that arrays have

97
00:05:22,350 --> 00:05:28,380
when we work with the DOM, we have at least 20, maybe 50 different methods, 50 different properties,

98
00:05:28,380 --> 00:05:31,080
and it takes time to get to know the ones you'll use the most.

99
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:36,210
And it's also imperative that you don't try and understand and learn every single property.

100
00:05:36,210 --> 00:05:38,760
That's something I'll bring up as we make some more progress.

101
00:05:38,760 --> 00:05:40,530
The DOM is just a huge thing.

102
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:45,300
There's so much to that you could stress about trying to learn and memorize.

103
00:05:45,300 --> 00:05:46,620
Don't approach it that way.

104
00:05:46,620 --> 00:05:51,900
We're going to go step by step and in the next video we'll take our first step into this beautiful promised

105
00:05:51,900 --> 00:05:53,190
land of the dom.
