1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:00,630
All right.

2
00:00:00,630 --> 00:00:06,180
So it's time for our first official video in the the real learning part of this Dom stuff.

3
00:00:06,180 --> 00:00:09,000
We saw some demos, we got a little taste of the DOM.

4
00:00:09,030 --> 00:00:11,700
We talked about HTML and CSS and what you need to know.

5
00:00:11,700 --> 00:00:14,880
This is really video one of learning the dom.

6
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:19,410
So we're going to start with the most important part of the DOM, the document.

7
00:00:19,470 --> 00:00:25,860
Remember Dom stands for document object model and the DOM is just a representation of an actual document

8
00:00:25,860 --> 00:00:30,060
made with a bunch of objects and they're assembled into a tree.

9
00:00:30,060 --> 00:00:35,640
This shape that we see over here, there's a hierarchy there, not just sitting out there in some random

10
00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:36,240
order.

11
00:00:36,270 --> 00:00:38,340
They're not in an array, for example.

12
00:00:38,340 --> 00:00:39,270
I mean, they could be.

13
00:00:39,270 --> 00:00:43,740
But then how would we know the relationships between parents and children and the structure?

14
00:00:43,740 --> 00:00:50,640
So they are put in a tree like structure here with branches, and in every tree there is a top most

15
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:55,680
piece, what we call the root of the tree, which is kind of the opposite of a regular tree, I guess

16
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:57,030
the roots down at the bottom.

17
00:00:57,030 --> 00:01:03,720
But anyway, we've got the root of the tree, which when we work with the DOM is an object called document.

18
00:01:04,019 --> 00:01:09,060
So document is an object you have in every single browser window that you ever open.

19
00:01:09,060 --> 00:01:11,280
You can type document every web page.

20
00:01:11,670 --> 00:01:12,840
Here's one of mine.

21
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:15,750
This one, this simple HTML and CSS demo.

22
00:01:15,750 --> 00:01:20,580
If I type document right here, I get a annoying printout.

23
00:01:20,580 --> 00:01:22,410
This is not what it actually is.

24
00:01:22,410 --> 00:01:27,720
This is the dev tools just showing me the HTML in the document.

25
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:34,680
But if I do consul dear document we can see the actual underlying object.

26
00:01:35,050 --> 00:01:39,480
Now this object represents the entire page, this entire document.

27
00:01:39,690 --> 00:01:45,300
If I go to the MDM page, this is actually the docs for the document.

28
00:01:45,390 --> 00:01:51,060
If I look at document and do the same thing, console dear instead.

29
00:01:52,730 --> 00:01:56,270
We have another object and they follow the same pattern.

30
00:01:56,270 --> 00:01:58,550
They have a URL, right?

31
00:01:58,550 --> 00:02:00,040
There's a URL right there.

32
00:02:00,050 --> 00:02:02,440
My URL is different over here.

33
00:02:02,660 --> 00:02:04,340
I'm on a file protocol.

34
00:02:04,490 --> 00:02:07,760
I'm just viewing my HTML file versus here.

35
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:13,760
I'm looking at developer dot mozilla dot org and the document contains tons of properties, tons of

36
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:14,510
methods.

37
00:02:14,510 --> 00:02:17,210
This is really where we start with everything.

38
00:02:17,300 --> 00:02:24,860
So all of the other objects, all of the other pieces of the DOM are located within the document somewhere.

39
00:02:24,980 --> 00:02:31,550
It's all nested into a kind of large, confusing structure if you are trying to navigate it yourself.

40
00:02:31,550 --> 00:02:37,490
And if you recall from the last couple of videos, everything that I was doing, I was typing document

41
00:02:37,490 --> 00:02:46,160
dot something, document dot get element by ID, document dot, body, dot children document dot, get

42
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:47,480
elements by tag name.

43
00:02:47,480 --> 00:02:51,770
There's all of these different methods and properties and they're all contained within the document

44
00:02:51,770 --> 00:02:52,400
object.

45
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:59,390
So the document is the entry point that we use to access the DOM, to manipulate things, to just view

46
00:02:59,390 --> 00:03:04,250
the content in the DOM, but also to add events and add functionality.

47
00:03:04,250 --> 00:03:06,800
It's all located inside of this one object.

48
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:11,810
The document and everything else stems from there, so it's created for us automatically.

49
00:03:11,810 --> 00:03:14,450
We don't just like we don't create the dom ourselves.

50
00:03:14,450 --> 00:03:16,520
The browser does it when it loads the page.

51
00:03:16,520 --> 00:03:17,390
Same idea.

52
00:03:17,390 --> 00:03:22,160
The document will be there for you when a page is opened in the browser or when you view a web page.

53
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:27,440
If we take a look at my web page again, here's the document that I printed out as an object.

54
00:03:27,980 --> 00:03:31,640
We'll see a couple of other things that might make sense right now.

55
00:03:32,180 --> 00:03:33,590
How about images?

56
00:03:33,590 --> 00:03:35,990
This is a collection of images on the page.

57
00:03:35,990 --> 00:03:37,550
There's one image right now.

58
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:43,130
If I go to the N version and I look at document dot images.

59
00:03:46,010 --> 00:03:48,770
We have, what, 12 images on this page?

60
00:03:49,220 --> 00:03:55,290
If we go back to my version and we instead look at something like, how about documents?

61
00:03:55,310 --> 00:03:56,480
All right, here.

62
00:03:56,900 --> 00:04:03,260
This is a property that contains every single element on the page, things we see and don't see.

63
00:04:03,260 --> 00:04:08,120
So the title meta tags, the head script tags, if we have any.

64
00:04:08,150 --> 00:04:09,570
They're all included here.

65
00:04:09,590 --> 00:04:15,620
Every single one is turned into a JavaScript object and itself has tons and tons of properties.

66
00:04:15,740 --> 00:04:20,810
And as you can see here, if you were trying to navigate this manually and trying to understand it all,

67
00:04:20,839 --> 00:04:22,970
this is just completely overwhelming.

68
00:04:23,270 --> 00:04:26,010
But fortunately, we really don't need to know most of it.

69
00:04:26,030 --> 00:04:29,050
So the main takeaway here is that we get all these objects for free.

70
00:04:29,060 --> 00:04:35,150
We load up the a web page in the browser, whether it's a file or we're going to some website and the

71
00:04:35,150 --> 00:04:39,740
DOM is created, all of it is stored inside of one object called the document.

72
00:04:39,740 --> 00:04:44,300
But the document has references to all those other objects, as you can see here.

73
00:04:44,630 --> 00:04:48,980
If I go to document, all this is just one way of looking at other elements.

74
00:04:48,980 --> 00:04:50,750
I've got 12 know what?

75
00:04:50,750 --> 00:04:52,420
21 different elements.

76
00:04:52,430 --> 00:04:58,340
If I do it on MSDN, that document object all has holy cow.

77
00:04:58,370 --> 00:05:01,010
18,940 elements.

78
00:05:01,010 --> 00:05:07,730
And each one is going to be a big, massive, crazy object that has tons of stuff inside of it.

79
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,080
So that's it for now.

80
00:05:09,080 --> 00:05:14,510
The document is our entry point, and that's why all of these methods we run, all of these properties

81
00:05:14,510 --> 00:05:20,330
we'll look at, or at least the majority of them start with document something, documents do something.

82
00:05:20,330 --> 00:05:23,360
So we'll see our first batch of methods in the very next video.

83
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:24,500
Very exciting, I think.

84
00:05:24,500 --> 00:05:25,700
Maybe by.
