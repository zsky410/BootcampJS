1
00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:00,600
Okay.

2
00:00:00,600 --> 00:00:03,070
So if you're still with me, we made our deck of cards.

3
00:00:03,090 --> 00:00:04,970
Object called my deck.

4
00:00:04,980 --> 00:00:06,480
It's a single object.

5
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:09,390
And right now, I don't have a way of making another one.

6
00:00:09,390 --> 00:00:14,040
So I'm just going to show you a quick and dirty approach to creating multiple decks.

7
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:17,210
This approach I'm going to show you is not the end all, be all.

8
00:00:17,220 --> 00:00:20,310
This is not the best way of doing it.

9
00:00:20,310 --> 00:00:24,990
But we haven't covered things that we would need in order to structure this in a nicer way.

10
00:00:24,990 --> 00:00:30,300
We haven't covered constructors, we haven't talked about the new keyword, we haven't talked about

11
00:00:30,900 --> 00:00:31,890
classes.

12
00:00:31,890 --> 00:00:36,660
There's a lot of stuff we have to get to where we could refactor this nicer, nicer.

13
00:00:36,660 --> 00:00:38,540
We could refactor this in a better way.

14
00:00:38,550 --> 00:00:44,460
But what I'm going to show you here is a very basic approach where we could just make a function that

15
00:00:44,460 --> 00:00:46,290
makes one of these decks for us.

16
00:00:46,650 --> 00:00:49,470
It's long, but I could just copy this.

17
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:51,330
Define a function down here.

18
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:54,030
I'll do an arrow function for the sake of variety.

19
00:00:54,030 --> 00:00:56,430
Let's go with make deck.

20
00:00:59,060 --> 00:01:02,600
And make DEC is going to return.

21
00:01:03,510 --> 00:01:04,950
This whole object.

22
00:01:05,670 --> 00:01:07,200
So our entire deck.

23
00:01:07,230 --> 00:01:13,170
This thing I copied, except for the variable name and the equal sign I copied from curly brace to curly

24
00:01:13,170 --> 00:01:13,710
brace.

25
00:01:14,010 --> 00:01:19,260
So now we have this function called make deck, and I could just delete this entirely.

26
00:01:20,450 --> 00:01:22,940
We're returning this whole object.

27
00:01:22,940 --> 00:01:25,400
And we could even do this implicitly if we wanted to.

28
00:01:25,430 --> 00:01:26,630
Just put Perrins.

29
00:01:26,660 --> 00:01:28,340
Get rid of the return keyword.

30
00:01:29,150 --> 00:01:36,620
So to use it instead of calling my deck dot initialized deck, I now need to say const my deck equals

31
00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:38,090
make deck.

32
00:01:39,020 --> 00:01:41,240
And this returns to me a new deck.

33
00:01:41,270 --> 00:01:42,490
Let's make sure it works.

34
00:01:42,500 --> 00:01:43,520
My deck.

35
00:01:45,660 --> 00:01:46,440
There we go.

36
00:01:46,590 --> 00:01:49,140
So we have this deck I drew.

37
00:01:49,170 --> 00:01:50,070
How many cards from this?

38
00:01:50,070 --> 00:01:50,920
Nine cards.

39
00:01:50,940 --> 00:01:53,580
If we want a second deck, we'll go with cost.

40
00:01:53,580 --> 00:01:57,240
Deck two equals make deck.

41
00:01:58,590 --> 00:01:59,450
Do it again.

42
00:01:59,460 --> 00:02:03,320
Let's look at deck two and then let's also initialize it.

43
00:02:03,330 --> 00:02:04,210
So deck two.

44
00:02:04,830 --> 00:02:07,020
Initialize deck and deck two.

45
00:02:08,070 --> 00:02:11,160
Let's not shuffle this one just so we can see the difference.

46
00:02:11,370 --> 00:02:13,770
So we have deck two now.

47
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:17,430
It has 52 cards, no drawn cards.

48
00:02:17,940 --> 00:02:19,050
It's all looking good.

49
00:02:19,050 --> 00:02:25,860
And then if we look at my deck, it has 43 cards and they are all shuffled, as you can see here.

50
00:02:25,860 --> 00:02:27,810
And we have nine cards that we've drawn.

51
00:02:27,810 --> 00:02:30,330
So we have totally separate decks.

52
00:02:30,330 --> 00:02:36,090
They are separate objects because we made a function to return an object.

53
00:02:36,210 --> 00:02:42,240
So we're returning a new deck each time a new object with these methods draw card, draw, multiple

54
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:47,460
shuffle initialized deck, a separate deck array, a separate drawing cards array.

55
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:50,250
And we return that every time we call make deck.

56
00:02:50,250 --> 00:02:52,560
So now we have a way of creating multiple.

57
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:55,920
But just to reiterate, this is not the best way of doing it.

58
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:58,320
It's the best way of doing it with what we know right now.

59
00:02:58,320 --> 00:03:03,750
And it's certainly better than doing it with all those functions and all the stuff we saw in the last

60
00:03:03,750 --> 00:03:04,080
video.

61
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:05,520
This is still pretty clean.

62
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:06,540
It's not too bad.

63
00:03:06,660 --> 00:03:08,100
And I'm going to stop here.

64
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:14,250
So we're going to move on to Dom manipulation for a bit, take a break from all this object stuff and

65
00:03:14,250 --> 00:03:19,980
working with this, we'll see how to work with HTML and CSS through JavaScript, how we can add events

66
00:03:19,980 --> 00:03:25,860
to our page, lots of fun stuff, and then we'll come back to objects because it's a big topic.

67
00:03:25,860 --> 00:03:31,680
We'll talk about classes and constructors and we'll see different ways of structuring this code already.
