1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:03,540
So that's the basics of adding a method to a object.

2
00:00:03,570 --> 00:00:05,250
It's just a key value pair.

3
00:00:05,280 --> 00:00:06,870
The function is the value.

4
00:00:06,930 --> 00:00:08,070
Now, I didn't show this.

5
00:00:08,070 --> 00:00:09,920
You can use an arrow function.

6
00:00:09,930 --> 00:00:14,970
It's not that common for reasons you'll see in just a moment once we talk about the keyword this.

7
00:00:15,330 --> 00:00:20,640
But in addition, there is a nice new shorthand for adding a method to an object where we don't have

8
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:25,290
to use the key value pair syntax, where we have a key colon and then a function.

9
00:00:25,290 --> 00:00:27,570
Instead we can write a function like this.

10
00:00:27,570 --> 00:00:31,560
So we give it a name and this name will be used to create the key.

11
00:00:31,950 --> 00:00:37,920
We still need our commas to separate the properties, but now we don't have to do the key colon value.

12
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:40,500
So this is a newer syntax.

13
00:00:40,650 --> 00:00:46,830
If we want to try it out, we'll make an object here called Auth and we'll have some dummy functions

14
00:00:46,830 --> 00:00:49,920
like log in and log in.

15
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:54,960
We'll simply console that log logged you in like that.

16
00:00:55,350 --> 00:00:55,740
All right.

17
00:00:55,740 --> 00:01:01,440
So nothing very extravagant, but we have a function in here and it's actually a method.

18
00:01:01,530 --> 00:01:04,170
If we look at Auth, this is what it turned into.

19
00:01:04,590 --> 00:01:10,110
We have log in as the key and then the function that corresponds to it as the value.

20
00:01:10,380 --> 00:01:12,690
So it uses this to create the key.

21
00:01:13,440 --> 00:01:17,340
And again, we do need commas if we have more than one property in here.

22
00:01:17,340 --> 00:01:23,220
So instead of auth if I wanted to add username is Tommy boy Tommy.

23
00:01:23,220 --> 00:01:27,600
But sure we need a comma and it still works.

24
00:01:28,380 --> 00:01:31,590
We now have two properties to add another method in.

25
00:01:31,590 --> 00:01:32,430
Same thing.

26
00:01:32,430 --> 00:01:37,670
I need my comma here and then we can go with log out and we'll cancel that log.

27
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:38,460
Goodbye.

28
00:01:38,820 --> 00:01:41,040
Now we'll take a look at Auth one more time.

29
00:01:41,700 --> 00:01:43,680
And we have three properties.

30
00:01:43,890 --> 00:01:47,380
If we leave that comma out, it's not happy with us.

31
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:48,780
It doesn't know what to do.

32
00:01:49,110 --> 00:01:50,660
We are in an object.

33
00:01:50,670 --> 00:01:55,200
Even if we're using this nice shorthand, we still need to separate all properties by commas.

34
00:01:55,830 --> 00:01:56,920
And that's kind of it.

35
00:01:56,940 --> 00:01:58,220
It's a nice shorthand.

36
00:01:58,230 --> 00:02:04,170
It is new, so it's not something that you may see all the time in older tutorials, but it's here for

37
00:02:04,170 --> 00:02:04,620
a reason.

38
00:02:04,620 --> 00:02:07,810
We do this so often we add properties to an object.

39
00:02:07,830 --> 00:02:09,300
This is just cleaner.

40
00:02:09,300 --> 00:02:15,420
We don't have to write this log in key colon and then a function expression.

41
00:02:15,690 --> 00:02:21,090
We don't have to clutter our code with the function keyword or if we use an arrow function we still

42
00:02:21,090 --> 00:02:22,350
would be cluttering this.

43
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:25,140
Just show you that we can do an arrow function.

44
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:30,150
We still are cluttering our code here with the login key, the colon.

45
00:02:30,210 --> 00:02:32,160
Just additional here.

46
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:33,420
It's a lot shorter.

47
00:02:34,510 --> 00:02:35,080
Okay.

48
00:02:35,110 --> 00:02:36,070
And that's it.

49
00:02:36,100 --> 00:02:37,630
Next, we've got a big one.

50
00:02:37,630 --> 00:02:42,610
We're going to talk about the keyword, this really fundamental thing in JavaScript that helps us write

51
00:02:42,610 --> 00:02:45,100
much more useful methods in our objects.
