1
00:00:00,090 --> 00:00:00,900
Fruit Loops are great.

2
00:00:00,900 --> 00:00:01,859
We use them a ton.

3
00:00:01,890 --> 00:00:06,960
I'll show you a few more situations where we use them with strings, where we use them with arrays.

4
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:09,930
But first I want to talk about something that's not so great.

5
00:00:09,930 --> 00:00:14,160
And this is true of many types of loops across all languages.

6
00:00:14,340 --> 00:00:19,290
You can write infinite loops and an infinite loop is something you absolutely want to avoid.

7
00:00:19,350 --> 00:00:20,810
Do not run this code.

8
00:00:20,820 --> 00:00:22,170
It's not going to break your computer.

9
00:00:22,170 --> 00:00:29,550
It's not going to set it on fire or crash anything but your window that you run it in on your browser

10
00:00:29,550 --> 00:00:34,050
is going to be very unhappy and I might show you what happens.

11
00:00:34,140 --> 00:00:39,540
I definitely have written many infinite loops accidentally and I'll talk about how that happens.

12
00:00:39,540 --> 00:00:45,480
But the idea behind the infinite loop is that you write a loop where the ending condition is never met.

13
00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:50,000
So the second part of your for loop in this case would always be true.

14
00:00:50,010 --> 00:00:51,390
So here's an example.

15
00:00:51,390 --> 00:00:53,890
I'm saying start at 20.

16
00:00:53,910 --> 00:00:56,700
Add one to each time and run this loop.

17
00:00:56,700 --> 00:01:02,580
While IE is greater than or equal to zero, it's always going to be greater than or equal to zero because

18
00:01:02,580 --> 00:01:05,069
I'm always adding to I and it starts at 20.

19
00:01:05,190 --> 00:01:12,870
So it will run on and on and on and on and on until either JavaScript freaks out or the browser freaks

20
00:01:12,870 --> 00:01:13,380
out.

21
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:15,030
You'll see what happens.

22
00:01:15,030 --> 00:01:16,110
I guess I'll show it to you.

23
00:01:16,140 --> 00:01:17,610
I've committed to it at this point.

24
00:01:18,180 --> 00:01:23,370
So you want to be careful about this when you're writing a for loop and especially when you write while

25
00:01:23,370 --> 00:01:24,900
loops, which we'll cover next.

26
00:01:25,170 --> 00:01:28,320
So let's try and create one an infinite loop.

27
00:01:28,530 --> 00:01:36,270
Let's count, let's create an AI that starts at one and I'm going to add two to each time.

28
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:42,270
So maybe I'm trying to count two, four, six, eight and so on up until I hit 20.

29
00:01:42,570 --> 00:01:49,890
So my condition, a poorly written condition would be run this when AI is not equal to 20.

30
00:01:50,730 --> 00:01:52,110
But there's a problem here.

31
00:01:52,470 --> 00:01:56,070
I'm starting at one, I'm adding two to it each time.

32
00:01:56,310 --> 00:02:01,440
So we'll get three and then we'll get well, we'll get one, then three, then five, then seven.

33
00:02:01,440 --> 00:02:03,330
We'll never have 20.

34
00:02:03,330 --> 00:02:06,000
So it's always going to be not equal to 20.

35
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,290
We'll never hit 20.

36
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:11,700
We're counting on odd numbers because we start at one, so we blow right past it.

37
00:02:12,570 --> 00:02:14,490
Oh, gosh, here we go.

38
00:02:14,490 --> 00:02:15,480
I'm going to run it.

39
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:17,430
I'm being dramatic.

40
00:02:17,430 --> 00:02:18,420
It's not that bad.

41
00:02:20,570 --> 00:02:21,840
You can see what's happening here.

42
00:02:21,860 --> 00:02:24,440
We've already hit 2903.

43
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:26,990
And did my browser stop?

44
00:02:26,990 --> 00:02:27,200
Yeah.

45
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:28,610
Och, now it's lagging.

46
00:02:28,610 --> 00:02:34,400
I can't scroll, I can't click, it's getting all jittery, it's just going to keep going.

47
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:38,270
And then eventually Chrome is going to ask me if I want to kill the process.

48
00:02:38,270 --> 00:02:39,710
You might have seen that before.

49
00:02:39,740 --> 00:02:45,350
If you're trying to open something intensive in the browser or page is being weird, a little window

50
00:02:45,350 --> 00:02:48,320
pops up and says, Do you want to kill or wait on this web page?

51
00:02:48,740 --> 00:02:53,300
I'll click kill when that eventually pops up and I'll be back in a bit.

52
00:02:53,660 --> 00:02:54,180
Okay.

53
00:02:54,230 --> 00:02:55,880
So eventually I killed it.

54
00:02:56,210 --> 00:02:58,160
My computer is now very angry.

55
00:02:58,160 --> 00:03:01,250
You can hear the fans going most likely through the microphone.

56
00:03:01,370 --> 00:03:06,470
It got very warm because it's trying to do all these computations and there's no end in sight.

57
00:03:06,470 --> 00:03:08,630
It just keeps going and going and going and going.

58
00:03:08,630 --> 00:03:10,670
And that's not good behavior.

59
00:03:10,670 --> 00:03:13,130
So infinite loops or something we want to avoid.

60
00:03:13,130 --> 00:03:17,750
So in general, when you're doing a for loop, there's a couple of things to look out for before you

61
00:03:17,750 --> 00:03:18,650
ever run the code.

62
00:03:18,650 --> 00:03:22,820
The first is just pay attention and make sure you're going in the right direction.

63
00:03:22,820 --> 00:03:29,810
This is a simple one, but if you're trying to count backwards from 200 or from 100, let I equals 100

64
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:32,660
and we'll decrement by one.

65
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:36,470
We want this code to run when AI is greater than or equal to zero.

66
00:03:36,950 --> 00:03:39,770
But often, at least sometimes I do this.

67
00:03:39,770 --> 00:03:44,120
I'm so used to doing I less than or equal to something that that's what I'll go with.

68
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:45,830
And that causes an infinite loop.

69
00:03:45,950 --> 00:03:50,180
I usually catch myself, but it's just something to pay attention to make sure that if you're going

70
00:03:50,180 --> 00:03:54,740
backwards or you're going forwards, whichever direction you're going, that your condition here is

71
00:03:54,740 --> 00:03:55,610
appropriate.

72
00:03:55,610 --> 00:04:02,450
And the other piece of advice that I have is that I would pretty much never use equality or non equality

73
00:04:02,450 --> 00:04:03,410
in a for loop.

74
00:04:03,770 --> 00:04:08,750
If you're working with numbers, it's much better to do greater than or less than because then we would

75
00:04:08,750 --> 00:04:15,350
avoid a situation like this if I did want to count from three to 5 to 7 and I wanted to stop as soon

76
00:04:15,350 --> 00:04:21,350
as we get past 20, it would just be better if I said, well, I is less than or equal to 20, because

77
00:04:21,350 --> 00:04:23,270
even if we don't hit 20, exactly.

78
00:04:23,270 --> 00:04:28,610
If we're starting at one, we add two, we'll end up with 19 and then we get to 21.

79
00:04:28,610 --> 00:04:33,530
We skipped over 20, but the loop will still stop because this won't be true anymore.

80
00:04:34,010 --> 00:04:35,210
So just two things.

81
00:04:35,210 --> 00:04:37,010
Make sure you're going in the right direction.

82
00:04:37,250 --> 00:04:43,010
Your logic makes sense here and generally try to avoid equality and non equality there.

83
00:04:43,190 --> 00:04:47,780
I prefer to use greater than less than when I can, so I'm going to add a note here.

84
00:04:47,780 --> 00:04:49,070
Don't run this.

85
00:04:50,810 --> 00:04:52,400
This will cause an infinite loop.

86
00:04:53,510 --> 00:04:54,740
I'll get rid of that one.

87
00:04:54,950 --> 00:04:59,660
You probably will encounter an infinite loop or two, but at this point, hopefully you'll be able to

88
00:04:59,660 --> 00:05:01,190
identify what's going on.

89
00:05:01,220 --> 00:05:05,480
It will be very clear when your browser just starts freaking out at you and getting hot and jittery

90
00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:08,120
and laggy, it happens.

91
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:12,530
It's nothing to be ashamed of, but it's definitely something you want to be on the lookout for and

92
00:05:12,530 --> 00:05:13,940
try and prevent if you can.
