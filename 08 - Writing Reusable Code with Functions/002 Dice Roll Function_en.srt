1
00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:05,430
Let's try writing another function this time, something that doesn't just print grumpy text over and

2
00:00:05,430 --> 00:00:06,240
over and over.

3
00:00:06,270 --> 00:00:08,290
Let's do something with some variation.

4
00:00:08,310 --> 00:00:12,300
How about generating a random dice roll or a single die roll?

5
00:00:12,570 --> 00:00:14,160
So a number from zero?

6
00:00:14,190 --> 00:00:14,600
Nope.

7
00:00:14,610 --> 00:00:15,820
There's no zero die.

8
00:00:15,840 --> 00:00:17,010
1 to 6.

9
00:00:18,030 --> 00:00:21,030
And we'll name this function something that makes sense.

10
00:00:21,030 --> 00:00:22,560
Like roll die.

11
00:00:23,490 --> 00:00:27,870
So we need function, space, roll, die, curly braces.

12
00:00:27,870 --> 00:00:31,410
And now we need the logic to generate a random number from 0 to 6.

13
00:00:31,410 --> 00:00:34,980
So let's roll equal.

14
00:00:35,130 --> 00:00:37,620
And then we'll do math at random.

15
00:00:37,740 --> 00:00:40,260
You know how much I'm not a fan of this syntax.

16
00:00:40,260 --> 00:00:42,060
Math at random times six.

17
00:00:42,060 --> 00:00:45,950
And then we need to floor that math floor.

18
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:49,260
Remember, math at random gives us a decimal.

19
00:00:49,410 --> 00:00:51,330
So it would be like 0.2.

20
00:00:51,510 --> 00:00:55,230
And then we multiply it by six in order to get a larger range.

21
00:00:55,230 --> 00:00:57,420
So we're no longer just from 0 to 1.

22
00:00:57,420 --> 00:01:03,960
We're going from zero to, I guess right below six because the largest decimal will generate is 0.9

23
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:08,400
something we multiply by six and then we floor it to get rid of that decimal.

24
00:01:08,580 --> 00:01:15,060
So now we have a number from 0 to 5, but our dice roll or die roll should be from 1 to 6.

25
00:01:15,060 --> 00:01:16,290
So we add one.

26
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:20,370
The logic is not all that important really.

27
00:01:20,370 --> 00:01:24,660
We're still focusing on the fact that every time we call roll die, this code runs.

28
00:01:24,930 --> 00:01:33,090
This code happens to make a number from 1 to 6, a random number, and then let's cancel that log rolled

29
00:01:33,870 --> 00:01:40,500
and then string template literal the rule, refresh the page.

30
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:45,930
Nothing happens because we never executed this, we just registered it, we told JavaScript about it.

31
00:01:46,350 --> 00:01:53,610
So we will now execute it once we get rolled, two, rolled, three, four or five.

32
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:54,270
Cool.

33
00:01:54,540 --> 00:01:57,240
And we can do this within a loop if we wanted to.

34
00:01:57,270 --> 00:02:00,660
We can even call functions within other functions.

35
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:06,360
So some games we'll have you roll a bunch of dice at the same time, like Yahtzee.

36
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:08,550
I think you roll five or six.

37
00:02:09,389 --> 00:02:15,180
I know there's a bunch of other games, not much of a gambler, but let's make up a function called

38
00:02:15,450 --> 00:02:21,720
How about throw dice and throw dice will simply call roll die.

39
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:25,020
How about six times?

40
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:26,730
We could do it like this.

41
00:02:26,730 --> 00:02:28,140
Or we could do it with a loop.

42
00:02:28,140 --> 00:02:34,080
But just to make it simple and clear that it's running six times, I'll do it manually by writing it

43
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:39,270
out six times a loop would probably make more sense if we wanted to have throw dice in the future,

44
00:02:39,270 --> 00:02:41,010
potentially change the number of rolls.

45
00:02:41,010 --> 00:02:45,570
So we could have throw dice to throw dice six for different games.

46
00:02:45,570 --> 00:02:46,590
But this is good enough.

47
00:02:46,590 --> 00:02:47,490
We're not there yet.

48
00:02:48,030 --> 00:02:49,350
We'll refresh the page.

49
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:50,730
Nothing happens.

50
00:02:51,570 --> 00:02:54,270
And that's because I haven't executed either function.

51
00:02:54,270 --> 00:03:03,000
So I'm going to call throw dice if I can spell it, which in turn calls roll die six different times

52
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:06,420
each time this code runs and we get some number printed out.

53
00:03:07,230 --> 00:03:08,040
There we go.

54
00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:10,080
Four, six, one, four, two, two.

55
00:03:10,770 --> 00:03:14,310
So we've seen more repetition of how we define a function.

56
00:03:14,310 --> 00:03:19,320
But also the new component here is that we can call functions from inside other functions.

57
00:03:19,320 --> 00:03:21,810
We can call them in loops, you can call them in conditionals.

58
00:03:21,810 --> 00:03:23,490
We can call them pretty much anywhere.
