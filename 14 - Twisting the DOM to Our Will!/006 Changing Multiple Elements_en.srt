1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:04,770
We'll take a quick break from learning new properties and methods just to talk about how we can use

2
00:00:04,770 --> 00:00:06,960
what we've already learned on multiple elements.

3
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:09,960
Everything we've been doing so far is one thing at a time.

4
00:00:09,960 --> 00:00:16,740
We've been changing the inner HTML or the value of one input or one diff or whatever it is at a time.

5
00:00:16,890 --> 00:00:22,140
But often we want to effect changes in multiple elements and we know how to select multiple elements.

6
00:00:22,140 --> 00:00:28,140
We use query selector all, get elements by class name, get elements by tag name that gives us an array

7
00:00:28,140 --> 00:00:29,220
like object.

8
00:00:29,220 --> 00:00:34,500
So all we need to do is iterate over that object and then call whatever method or change whatever property

9
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:35,040
we want.

10
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:40,170
So why don't we start by changing the inner text of all allies on the page?

11
00:00:40,290 --> 00:00:45,990
So we need to select all the allies, and I'm going to do this in a separate file because it takes a

12
00:00:45,990 --> 00:00:46,920
couple of lines.

13
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:53,940
So I have a script as I've included it at the bottom of my HTML file and I'm going to select all the

14
00:00:53,940 --> 00:00:54,340
lists.

15
00:00:54,340 --> 00:00:58,500
So I need my document query selector all I want.

16
00:00:58,530 --> 00:01:03,360
Liz So I'll pass in the string ally and then I'll save that to a variable.

17
00:01:03,360 --> 00:01:08,220
But to go with const all Liz all these.

18
00:01:08,220 --> 00:01:11,730
Okay, now we want to iterate over all else.

19
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:21,600
So for we could do a regular for loop for let i equals zero I less than all allies length I plus plus

20
00:01:21,870 --> 00:01:25,560
and then we can access all allies of zero.

21
00:01:26,580 --> 00:01:32,580
And we could start by just constantly logging all our lies of zero dot let's do in our text.

22
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:34,980
Okay.

23
00:01:35,160 --> 00:01:36,720
Let's see what we get when I run this.

24
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:38,280
So I'll refresh the page.

25
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:39,450
Hmm.

26
00:01:40,050 --> 00:01:41,550
No idea why I did zero.

27
00:01:41,580 --> 00:01:43,770
It's supposed to be all allies of I.

28
00:01:44,190 --> 00:01:48,870
Whatever that loop iteration is, we'll access that one and get the inner text.

29
00:01:48,870 --> 00:01:50,280
And if we run it, there we go.

30
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:50,760
First thing.

31
00:01:50,760 --> 00:01:51,240
Second thing.

32
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:51,700
Third thing.

33
00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:53,160
Carrots, peas, broccoli.

34
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:56,970
So if I want to change them all, I can just set their inner text.

35
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:03,870
All allies of I dot inner text equals.

36
00:02:03,870 --> 00:02:06,360
And then this is the hardest part always.

37
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:09,690
How about we are the champions?

38
00:02:09,690 --> 00:02:12,810
I don't know why, but we'll just do it.

39
00:02:13,620 --> 00:02:13,940
Okay.

40
00:02:14,700 --> 00:02:16,530
What happens when I refresh the page?

41
00:02:16,530 --> 00:02:19,260
Every single line now has been updated.

42
00:02:20,130 --> 00:02:22,020
So this is the common pattern.

43
00:02:22,020 --> 00:02:27,750
We select a group of things and we iterate over that array like object using a for loop.

44
00:02:27,750 --> 00:02:34,440
Or we could easily do a for of loop, which I prefer for let ally of all allies.

45
00:02:36,690 --> 00:02:37,550
We will.

46
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:38,160
What should we do?

47
00:02:38,190 --> 00:02:49,100
How about ally dot in our HTML this time and let's pass in a string and we'll say we are.

48
00:02:49,110 --> 00:02:53,310
And then a bold tag, the champions.

49
00:02:55,790 --> 00:03:00,470
So now we're setting in HTML, which means that this will be treated as HTML.

50
00:03:00,470 --> 00:03:03,890
It will be parsed and turned into an actual bold element on the page.

51
00:03:04,220 --> 00:03:05,330
Let's see if it works.

52
00:03:06,490 --> 00:03:07,160
There we go.

53
00:03:07,180 --> 00:03:10,750
We are the champions on every single ally.

54
00:03:10,780 --> 00:03:13,090
So we're overwriting the changes we did here.

55
00:03:13,090 --> 00:03:14,530
But this also worked.

56
00:03:14,650 --> 00:03:16,720
It's just annoying to have to deal with AI.

57
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:21,340
So why not use a four of loop so we can do things like this?

58
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:27,040
Obviously we can change styles once we see how to change styles, which we will see very shortly.

59
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:31,720
We can access attributes, we can set attributes, we could do all sorts of things, but the pattern

60
00:03:31,720 --> 00:03:32,590
is the same.

61
00:03:32,620 --> 00:03:39,310
You select and then loop and then do something versus what we've seen so far where we select one thing

62
00:03:39,310 --> 00:03:42,020
and manipulate it directly without having to loop.

63
00:03:42,040 --> 00:03:44,050
If you have multiple, you have to loop.

64
00:03:44,050 --> 00:03:47,150
There's no easy shortcut to just impact all of them at once.

65
00:03:47,170 --> 00:03:47,590
All right.

66
00:03:47,590 --> 00:03:49,140
So that's it for this video.

67
00:03:49,150 --> 00:03:51,910
Next, we'll move on to some other properties and methods.
