1
00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:01,950
All right, if you're still with me.

2
00:00:01,950 --> 00:00:02,460
Thank you.

3
00:00:02,490 --> 00:00:03,450
Congratulations.

4
00:00:03,450 --> 00:00:04,760
We've covered a lot of methods.

5
00:00:04,770 --> 00:00:09,840
We have two more methods in this video, and that's it for new stuff in this section.

6
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:16,079
We'll then do a quick little project where we get practice creating elements, removing elements, inserting

7
00:00:16,079 --> 00:00:18,510
changing classes and styles and all of that stuff.

8
00:00:18,510 --> 00:00:21,870
And then we'll move on to a new section on events in the DOM.

9
00:00:21,870 --> 00:00:26,700
Now, events are really the main course of Dom stuff of these DOM sections.

10
00:00:26,730 --> 00:00:32,400
Events are probably the most exciting, but also the missing piece that we need in order to actually

11
00:00:32,400 --> 00:00:35,940
make useful applications and start to interact with our websites.

12
00:00:36,150 --> 00:00:39,450
So two more methods and then a project, then events.

13
00:00:39,450 --> 00:00:43,470
So the two methods are remove and remove child and they do what they sound like.

14
00:00:43,470 --> 00:00:46,290
They remove and remove an element that you pass in.

15
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:53,310
They follow the pattern that we saw with Append Child where this was the the original way of doing it,

16
00:00:53,310 --> 00:00:58,440
the older way of appending something as a child and it's supported in all browsers.

17
00:00:58,440 --> 00:01:02,640
But there's a newer method append that does not work in Internet Explorer.

18
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:06,030
It's a little friendlier to use and you can pass in multiple elements.

19
00:01:06,540 --> 00:01:07,950
Remove is similar.

20
00:01:07,950 --> 00:01:13,920
So we have removed child which has been around much longer and then we have remove which does not work

21
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:14,730
in AII.

22
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:19,410
And if you go to the docs for remove child, it's actually mildly confusing.

23
00:01:19,410 --> 00:01:25,770
On MDM, you scroll down to look at browser support compatibility unknown for E.

24
00:01:25,800 --> 00:01:28,500
So I had a feeling this was a mistake.

25
00:01:28,950 --> 00:01:31,500
Something is just wrong with with the data they have.

26
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:39,840
So on another website that I like called Can I use if you look at remove child for I it's been supported

27
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:44,040
in pretty much every version of I that they support on this website.

28
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:48,810
So I have no idea why MDM has a question mark there, but it is supported in IY.

29
00:01:48,810 --> 00:01:55,530
So to use remove child we need to find the parent of what we're trying to remove and find the item that

30
00:01:55,530 --> 00:01:56,580
we want to remove.

31
00:01:57,390 --> 00:01:58,980
So why don't we remove?

32
00:01:59,610 --> 00:02:02,160
Hmm, let's remove PS right here.

33
00:02:02,730 --> 00:02:05,220
So that element is down at the very bottom.

34
00:02:05,220 --> 00:02:11,850
We need to select that element which is in a UL and it has a class of special.

35
00:02:12,180 --> 00:02:15,690
So we need to select the UL parent and the ally.

36
00:02:16,140 --> 00:02:24,660
Let's get the parent first const UL equals document query selector and we have a couple of Uls on this

37
00:02:24,660 --> 00:02:25,320
page.

38
00:02:25,320 --> 00:02:28,650
What I'm going to do is select the one inside of a section.

39
00:02:30,040 --> 00:02:31,720
Which should give us that one down there.

40
00:02:31,720 --> 00:02:32,850
Let's see you.

41
00:02:34,130 --> 00:02:34,670
Yep.

42
00:02:34,670 --> 00:02:36,070
That one is at the bottom.

43
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:39,200
It's the only one contained inside of a section.

44
00:02:40,150 --> 00:02:46,150
Now, if I want to get this one ally that has the class of special, I have a couple of options I could

45
00:02:46,150 --> 00:02:53,980
just do document query selector, or I could search within the ul ul query selector for the class of

46
00:02:53,980 --> 00:02:54,700
special.

47
00:02:54,790 --> 00:03:00,970
And this is easy or easier because there's only one element with the class of special in that UL.

48
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:08,020
But if I instead did document that query selector, we have multiple other special classes or instances

49
00:03:08,020 --> 00:03:09,670
of special on the page.

50
00:03:09,670 --> 00:03:15,790
So it's, it's more work we would have to then say instead of a section, maybe that could get it.

51
00:03:15,790 --> 00:03:20,710
But I like doing this version here where we search within the UL and ignore everything else.

52
00:03:21,250 --> 00:03:24,520
All right, so I'm going to save that to a variable cost.

53
00:03:24,670 --> 00:03:25,720
Remove me.

54
00:03:26,050 --> 00:03:26,830
How about that?

55
00:03:26,920 --> 00:03:30,280
Remove me equals UL query selector special.

56
00:03:30,430 --> 00:03:31,960
So now we have that element.

57
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:41,950
Remove me and we have the parent ul I can call ul remove child and I want to remove the remove me element.

58
00:03:42,730 --> 00:03:43,450
All right.

59
00:03:43,450 --> 00:03:48,550
So the pattern is the parent and then remove child and then the child.

60
00:03:48,550 --> 00:03:51,550
And this child needs to be a child of the parent.

61
00:03:51,550 --> 00:03:57,160
So I couldn't select this ull and say that you'll remove child of this lie.

62
00:03:57,160 --> 00:03:58,090
It wouldn't work.

63
00:03:58,570 --> 00:04:03,720
Also, when we do remove a child, it does return the removed element so I can save it.

64
00:04:03,730 --> 00:04:08,020
I'll just call it const deleted if you wanted to do something with it.

65
00:04:08,900 --> 00:04:09,670
It's gone now.

66
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:10,730
Peace is gone.

67
00:04:10,730 --> 00:04:15,140
And if we look at deleted, we do have a variable here that is an object.

68
00:04:15,140 --> 00:04:18,140
It's the actual element that we were working with that we just removed.

69
00:04:18,170 --> 00:04:20,600
It's just printing out as HTML.

70
00:04:20,630 --> 00:04:25,880
Thanks to Chrome's lovely dev tools, which actually are lovely, except I hate this one feature.

71
00:04:25,880 --> 00:04:28,940
And then we also have the remove method which works differently.

72
00:04:29,030 --> 00:04:30,900
It does not need the parent node.

73
00:04:30,920 --> 00:04:36,850
All we need to do is select the target, the thing we want to remove and then call remove on that node

74
00:04:36,860 --> 00:04:39,110
on the actual item we want to remove.

75
00:04:39,500 --> 00:04:47,630
So if I want to remove the H one, for example, I can select it const H one equals document query selector

76
00:04:49,010 --> 00:04:50,030
of h one.

77
00:04:50,060 --> 00:04:53,680
There's only one on the page and I can call h one dot remove.

78
00:04:53,690 --> 00:04:54,920
I don't need the parent.

79
00:04:55,280 --> 00:05:02,870
If I was doing this with remove child, I would have to say document up body dot remove child of h one.

80
00:05:03,530 --> 00:05:06,050
But with remove it's easier.

81
00:05:06,050 --> 00:05:07,430
We don't have to have the parent.

82
00:05:07,460 --> 00:05:10,480
It just doesn't work in IY unfortunately.

83
00:05:10,490 --> 00:05:14,150
H one remove parentheses and it's gone.

84
00:05:14,330 --> 00:05:15,110
That's it.

85
00:05:15,110 --> 00:05:17,000
And that's pretty much it for this video.

86
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,970
We can remove using the remove method that we just saw.

87
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:20,750
We've got removed.

88
00:05:20,750 --> 00:05:25,280
Child You could do this in a loop, of course, if you had a bunch of things you wanted to remove,

89
00:05:25,760 --> 00:05:26,870
and that's kind of it.

90
00:05:26,900 --> 00:05:32,240
Now we've seen how to create elements, how to append them, pretend them, insert them before things,

91
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:34,910
insert adjacent to things and remove them.
