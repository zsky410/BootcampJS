1
00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:04,600
Next up, we'll see a few other methods we can use to add new elements to the DOM.

2
00:00:04,620 --> 00:00:06,780
We've seen a Penn child so far.

3
00:00:06,810 --> 00:00:08,100
We'll see other options.

4
00:00:08,100 --> 00:00:10,050
And we'll also talk about removing elements.

5
00:00:10,050 --> 00:00:14,070
How do we delete something from the DOM as we saw in the very last video?

6
00:00:14,130 --> 00:00:19,860
Append child takes a new element, but it's a method that we call on a parent.

7
00:00:19,860 --> 00:00:27,720
So to add a new ally to this list, I need to select the list so I could do document query selector.

8
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:29,550
Take the first.

9
00:00:29,700 --> 00:00:33,120
I think it's a UL query selector of UL.

10
00:00:33,150 --> 00:00:34,950
I'll call this parent UL.

11
00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:37,500
So I have that parent.

12
00:00:37,660 --> 00:00:41,250
Well, I'll make a new lie concept.

13
00:00:41,250 --> 00:00:47,310
New lie equals document create element of lie.

14
00:00:47,730 --> 00:00:54,540
And then I will set its inner text just to be something like I am a new lie.

15
00:00:56,360 --> 00:00:57,440
So we have that.

16
00:00:57,770 --> 00:01:00,050
Now I need to make sure my quotes match.

17
00:01:00,590 --> 00:01:05,720
When I do a pen child, it becomes the last element, the last child of the parent.

18
00:01:05,720 --> 00:01:12,770
So parent ul append child of new ly.

19
00:01:13,070 --> 00:01:16,130
That's what we get and that is useful sometimes.

20
00:01:16,130 --> 00:01:19,460
You do want to append at the end the last child of an element.

21
00:01:19,460 --> 00:01:24,020
But what if we wanted to put it at the beginning, make a new top to do?

22
00:01:24,050 --> 00:01:29,480
Maybe these are ordered by priority or, you know, due date or something like that.

23
00:01:29,480 --> 00:01:33,950
And I want my new to do to go up here or what if I want it to go in the middle?

24
00:01:34,070 --> 00:01:39,020
We have a different method called insert before now insert before.

25
00:01:39,020 --> 00:01:45,080
Sounds like the way that it would work is that we select a node and call insert before on it.

26
00:01:45,080 --> 00:01:53,660
So if I wanted to insert before this ally, you might think I select that ly and then I call first ly

27
00:01:54,110 --> 00:01:56,480
insert before new ly.

28
00:01:57,050 --> 00:01:58,490
But that's not how it works.

29
00:01:58,490 --> 00:02:04,340
We actually still have to select the parent and we have to select the element we want to insert before.

30
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:09,830
It's kind of annoying, not not knowing enough that you shouldn't use it, but it's just kind of cumbersome.

31
00:02:09,830 --> 00:02:15,170
So if I want to make this ally that I have down here, I want it to go up top above, mow the lawn.

32
00:02:15,170 --> 00:02:22,190
I need to first select mow the lawn so I'll make a variable called first ly equals document.

33
00:02:22,190 --> 00:02:23,810
And what's the best way to select it?

34
00:02:23,810 --> 00:02:26,720
I think it's the very first ly on the entire page.

35
00:02:27,380 --> 00:02:29,270
Let me just double check over here.

36
00:02:29,420 --> 00:02:30,470
We've got.

37
00:02:30,470 --> 00:02:30,860
Yeah.

38
00:02:30,860 --> 00:02:32,600
Or it's the first to do on the page.

39
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:33,560
We could do it that way.

40
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:39,890
If you want to get more specific the first ly with the class of to do and if we look at it there it

41
00:02:39,890 --> 00:02:40,370
is.

42
00:02:40,880 --> 00:02:42,470
So I have all the pieces I need.

43
00:02:42,470 --> 00:02:45,620
I have my new ally that I've made right now.

44
00:02:45,620 --> 00:02:48,170
It's down here, but I still have a reference to that.

45
00:02:48,170 --> 00:02:50,990
So if I move it, it will move from down here.

46
00:02:51,170 --> 00:02:56,900
Then we also have the first ly I want to insert before and I have the parent you will.

47
00:02:56,900 --> 00:03:03,020
So here is how I would insert my ly at the top of the ul i call parent ul.

48
00:03:03,790 --> 00:03:06,340
Dot and then insert before.

49
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:14,680
And then the annoying part is we have to say the new thing, we want to insert new lie and where I want

50
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:21,740
to insert it, where I want to insert it before I want to insert it before the first lie.

51
00:03:22,870 --> 00:03:23,230
Okay.

52
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:29,140
So the way it structured again, we have to have the parent of what we're trying to insert into and

53
00:03:29,140 --> 00:03:34,390
then we also have to select what we want to insert before and then what we are actually inserting.

54
00:03:34,780 --> 00:03:35,800
And there we go.

55
00:03:36,190 --> 00:03:38,980
It's now inserted as a child of parent.

56
00:03:38,990 --> 00:03:45,940
Well, but it's also before first lie and if I wanted to move it right above feed the alpacas, I need

57
00:03:45,940 --> 00:03:47,080
to select that one.

58
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:49,540
So I'll call that last ul Konst.

59
00:03:49,540 --> 00:03:53,350
The last you will equals document query selector.

60
00:03:53,470 --> 00:04:01,210
I'm going to do selector all of lie with the class of to do and then take the index of two, which is

61
00:04:01,210 --> 00:04:02,770
the third 101.

62
00:04:02,770 --> 00:04:08,080
Nope, it's the third one or it's a fourth one index of three because we inserted this so that should

63
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:08,860
give me.

64
00:04:09,010 --> 00:04:10,660
No that did not give it to me.

65
00:04:11,140 --> 00:04:13,540
Let's see last Uhl.

66
00:04:13,570 --> 00:04:15,280
Actually, I was wrong here.

67
00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:20,380
Index of three is only going to work if I actually had four elements with the class of two.

68
00:04:20,380 --> 00:04:24,430
Do I forgot that this one up top does not have to do so.

69
00:04:24,430 --> 00:04:27,610
We'll get rid of that and change it to index of two.

70
00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:32,830
But I've already declared this variable, so I'm going to call this last to do.

71
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:43,390
So now I can insert I'll do parent ul dot insert before and then I want to insert the new ly before

72
00:04:43,420 --> 00:04:45,070
the last to do.

73
00:04:45,980 --> 00:04:47,000
And there we go.

74
00:04:47,030 --> 00:04:51,110
It now is right before the last two do feed the alpacas.

75
00:04:51,140 --> 00:04:55,810
We also have a completely different method that we could use called insert adjacent element.

76
00:04:55,820 --> 00:04:58,010
And this one's a bit more complicated.

77
00:04:58,040 --> 00:04:59,390
We passed in an element.

78
00:04:59,390 --> 00:05:05,750
We have to have a target element, but then we also pass in a position and this is a string which might

79
00:05:05,750 --> 00:05:12,560
seem odd, but we have four choices before begin, after begin, before end and after end.

80
00:05:12,860 --> 00:05:16,400
So if you imagine that this is our target, we have a paragraph.

81
00:05:16,550 --> 00:05:22,370
If we want to insert something before this paragraph, we would pass in before begin.

82
00:05:22,370 --> 00:05:28,220
If we want to insert it after we use after end and then if we want to insert it as the first child of

83
00:05:28,220 --> 00:05:32,600
the paragraph after begin and before end will be the last child.

84
00:05:33,550 --> 00:05:35,830
So let's try this just one or two times.

85
00:05:35,830 --> 00:05:37,960
We can use the same lie, I guess.

86
00:05:37,960 --> 00:05:41,140
Or actually let's make a new element and we'll just be a bold tag.

87
00:05:41,170 --> 00:05:42,330
Or how about an eye tag?

88
00:05:42,340 --> 00:05:46,990
Document creates element of eye.

89
00:05:48,530 --> 00:05:52,850
And we'll call this eye tag or I whatever.

90
00:05:52,850 --> 00:05:54,410
It's not a great name, but that's fine.

91
00:05:54,860 --> 00:05:59,570
And then we'll do I enter text equals I am italics.

92
00:06:01,100 --> 00:06:02,450
So we have our eye tag.

93
00:06:02,630 --> 00:06:05,120
Now let's select one of these elements.

94
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:08,480
How about the very first paragraph on our page?

95
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:12,290
So that will be document query selector p.

96
00:06:13,870 --> 00:06:16,450
Save that to const first p.

97
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:24,210
Now I can call first p insert adjacent element and then I have to specify where.

98
00:06:24,230 --> 00:06:27,170
So if I do before I begin.

99
00:06:28,860 --> 00:06:34,050
And this method, I think, is kind of unpopular, mainly because you have to remember these strings

100
00:06:34,050 --> 00:06:38,220
and a lot of the time you just want to insert something as the last child anyway, so you can use a

101
00:06:38,220 --> 00:06:43,290
pen child and shortly I'll show you two other methods append and pretend.

102
00:06:43,290 --> 00:06:47,460
But here we can pass in before begin and then our new AI element.

103
00:06:48,210 --> 00:06:53,280
And if we take a look, it was inserted before the paragraph began.

104
00:06:53,490 --> 00:06:56,730
So that's a way of inserting something before the paragraph.

105
00:06:56,730 --> 00:07:01,860
And I personally think this is nicer, even if you have to remember before begin, it's better than

106
00:07:01,860 --> 00:07:09,000
what we did earlier when we had to select the parent, insert before the target, and then the new element.

107
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:13,260
Let's try the same line, but we'll do after end.

108
00:07:14,580 --> 00:07:19,020
Now it goes after the paragraph, after the paragraph ends.

109
00:07:19,230 --> 00:07:22,440
And if we do after begin.

110
00:07:24,110 --> 00:07:26,960
It goes into the paragraph element itself.

111
00:07:27,350 --> 00:07:29,720
After the opening tag, the beginning tag.

112
00:07:29,750 --> 00:07:30,710
It goes right there.

113
00:07:30,710 --> 00:07:36,980
And then we have the final option before end, which we'll put it right here before the end of the paragraph.

114
00:07:37,580 --> 00:07:38,630
One more time.

115
00:07:38,630 --> 00:07:40,280
Before end.

116
00:07:40,640 --> 00:07:41,660
For end.

117
00:07:42,230 --> 00:07:43,550
And there it is.

118
00:07:43,640 --> 00:07:45,950
So another option for inserting.

119
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:52,030
I did mention there are two other methods we can talk about called append and present.

120
00:07:52,760 --> 00:07:53,580
These are newer.

121
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:59,330
They do not work in Internet Explorer, of course, and they're just a little bit simpler than append

122
00:07:59,330 --> 00:08:00,050
child.

123
00:08:00,320 --> 00:08:02,280
And also there is no pre pen child.

124
00:08:02,300 --> 00:08:08,270
So Append is different from a pen child in that we can actually insert multiple elements at once.

125
00:08:08,450 --> 00:08:11,030
So if I have this paragraph tag, let's see.

126
00:08:11,030 --> 00:08:14,330
I have my eye still and I have my new ally, right?

127
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:15,590
Nope.

128
00:08:15,620 --> 00:08:16,220
What do I.

129
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:20,570
New ly all caps or l capital i capital.

130
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:21,980
So we have two elements.

131
00:08:21,980 --> 00:08:27,500
If I want to insert both of them into this paragraph, which we shouldn't really just put an ly in a

132
00:08:27,500 --> 00:08:28,130
paragraph.

133
00:08:28,130 --> 00:08:31,010
But if I wanted to I could use append.

134
00:08:31,010 --> 00:08:32,440
So it looks like this.

135
00:08:32,450 --> 00:08:40,070
The first paragraph that we already selected append and then we can pass in AI and new ly.

136
00:08:40,159 --> 00:08:44,240
And now both of them have been appended inside that paragraph.

137
00:08:44,330 --> 00:08:48,920
The italics tag was already there, so it kind of looks like nothing happened.

138
00:08:49,160 --> 00:08:50,950
But it did happen, I promise.

139
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:58,220
And we also have pre penned, which is the same idea, except it will make things a first child.

140
00:08:58,220 --> 00:09:03,080
So it still will be a child of the paragraph, but it will go to the beginning of the paragraph.

141
00:09:03,830 --> 00:09:04,750
And there we go.

142
00:09:04,760 --> 00:09:07,370
If we look, we've got am italics.

143
00:09:07,370 --> 00:09:08,390
I am a new ly.

144
00:09:08,420 --> 00:09:12,020
They're still inside the paragraph, but they are at the very beginning.

145
00:09:12,410 --> 00:09:14,360
So append and pretend are nice.

146
00:09:14,360 --> 00:09:15,080
They're short.

147
00:09:15,080 --> 00:09:16,610
You don't have to do a pen child.

148
00:09:16,610 --> 00:09:21,140
I mean, you just save a couple of letters, but with a pen child you cannot insert multiple.

149
00:09:21,530 --> 00:09:25,670
If I did a pen child here, it's not going to be happy with me.

150
00:09:25,880 --> 00:09:28,190
We get the one element inserted.

151
00:09:28,340 --> 00:09:31,570
I am italics, but the ly was never added.

152
00:09:31,580 --> 00:09:33,160
It just stayed where it was.

153
00:09:33,170 --> 00:09:39,380
So append is cool because you can do that but it does not work in i e neither does pre penned woof.

154
00:09:39,380 --> 00:09:41,540
So many different ways of adding elements.

155
00:09:41,810 --> 00:09:43,030
Stick with the couple.

156
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:44,870
You don't have to master all of them.

157
00:09:45,530 --> 00:09:47,270
A pen child is usually good enough.

158
00:09:47,270 --> 00:09:49,070
If you have multiple you can do append.

159
00:09:49,070 --> 00:09:51,770
Maybe you can do insert adjacent element.

160
00:09:51,770 --> 00:09:54,690
You just have to remember the syntax you've got pre penned.

161
00:09:54,710 --> 00:09:57,110
Next I'll show you some ways of removing elements.
