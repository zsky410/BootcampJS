1
00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:06,390
Next up, we'll see how we can create elements from scratch and insert them or add them to the DOM so

2
00:00:06,390 --> 00:00:09,690
we could create an image, give it a source and put it on.

3
00:00:09,690 --> 00:00:12,680
I don't know the beginning of the page or put it inside of a div.

4
00:00:12,690 --> 00:00:17,190
We could create 100 links with different URLs and insert them into the DOM.

5
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:18,540
So here's how we do it.

6
00:00:18,540 --> 00:00:23,010
The first step is to make an element, and we have a method called create element.

7
00:00:23,220 --> 00:00:25,560
So create element is actually really simple.

8
00:00:25,590 --> 00:00:29,490
It's document, create, not attribute create element.

9
00:00:29,940 --> 00:00:33,510
And you pass an a string of the type of element you would like.

10
00:00:33,510 --> 00:00:41,490
So if we want to make a let's do ah2 element, we pass in H two and that's all we get.

11
00:00:41,490 --> 00:00:43,560
It makes an empty element for us.

12
00:00:43,560 --> 00:00:47,520
But as we've seen many times so far, this is not what it actually looks like.

13
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:50,010
This is only the HTML representation.

14
00:00:50,190 --> 00:00:51,510
Let's save it to a variable.

15
00:00:51,510 --> 00:00:59,040
We'll call this new H two and then let's do our console deer of new h two.

16
00:01:00,720 --> 00:01:01,680
It's an object.

17
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:05,630
So we're making a new element of type H two.

18
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:12,090
And if we take a look at the element itself, we have let's see, we've got a HTML heading element.

19
00:01:12,090 --> 00:01:13,980
That's the type of element it is.

20
00:01:13,980 --> 00:01:16,320
And we have tag name set to H two.

21
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:18,180
And there's no text content.

22
00:01:18,180 --> 00:01:21,720
There is no inner content or inner HTML, inner text.

23
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:23,130
They're both empty.

24
00:01:23,460 --> 00:01:27,000
So if we want to put some content in, that's a separate step.

25
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:29,460
All we've done is make an element.

26
00:01:29,460 --> 00:01:31,380
So we made an empty H two.

27
00:01:31,410 --> 00:01:35,730
Then if we want to add into it, we could do new H two.

28
00:01:36,150 --> 00:01:38,280
So let's just look at new h21 more time.

29
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:39,120
It's empty.

30
00:01:39,120 --> 00:01:42,420
New age to enter text equals.

31
00:01:43,260 --> 00:01:44,340
What should we put here?

32
00:01:44,820 --> 00:01:47,220
I like animals.

33
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:48,180
Sure.

34
00:01:48,780 --> 00:01:50,460
Oh, miss.

35
00:01:50,460 --> 00:01:51,150
My quote.

36
00:01:51,180 --> 00:01:56,100
Okay, so now if we look at New H two, here's the representation of it.

37
00:01:56,100 --> 00:01:58,170
I can also continue to manipulate it.

38
00:01:58,170 --> 00:02:01,020
I can add a class if I wanted to.

39
00:02:01,260 --> 00:02:08,789
I would just do new to new h two dot class list is probably the easiest way to add.

40
00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:11,670
And what classes do we even have?

41
00:02:11,700 --> 00:02:14,340
Do we have any good ones we have to.

42
00:02:14,340 --> 00:02:16,440
Do we have special?

43
00:02:16,470 --> 00:02:18,810
Let's use the class of special.

44
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:29,330
Now we look at h two or nu h two, and that's what we got an h two attribute of class set to special

45
00:02:29,330 --> 00:02:31,670
and the inner text of I like animals.

46
00:02:31,790 --> 00:02:33,500
So how do we get it in the DOM?

47
00:02:33,500 --> 00:02:34,630
How do we get it to show up?

48
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:41,280
Right now it's completely severed in its own little universe in the womb of the JavaScript console.

49
00:02:41,300 --> 00:02:43,760
How do we get it into the real world, onto the page?

50
00:02:43,790 --> 00:02:45,950
How do we deliver this element?

51
00:02:45,980 --> 00:02:47,730
Okay, enough of that metaphor here.

52
00:02:47,750 --> 00:02:51,890
What we need to do is select an element to append it to.

53
00:02:52,190 --> 00:02:53,730
So we have some methods here.

54
00:02:53,750 --> 00:02:56,600
The first one we'll see is called Append Child.

55
00:02:56,600 --> 00:02:57,410
Where are you?

56
00:02:57,540 --> 00:02:58,550
They put that on here.

57
00:02:58,820 --> 00:02:59,540
There it is.

58
00:02:59,570 --> 00:03:00,740
Append child.

59
00:03:00,740 --> 00:03:07,160
So append child is a method that we call on a parent that we want to append an element into.

60
00:03:07,550 --> 00:03:13,700
So if I wanted to append this H to into let's go to our HTML.

61
00:03:14,030 --> 00:03:16,460
How about we put it in this section here?

62
00:03:16,550 --> 00:03:23,420
I will select the section and then call append child on the section and pass in our new H to.

63
00:03:23,690 --> 00:03:30,050
So we'll select that section document dot query selector of section.

64
00:03:30,890 --> 00:03:40,250
Save that to a variable and then we'll call section append child and we pass it in our new H to.

65
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:46,820
This is the new element we've already made and we're now connecting it into the DOM by saying append

66
00:03:46,820 --> 00:03:52,570
a child to the section and a child just means anything inside of this section.

67
00:03:52,580 --> 00:03:54,620
We've already seen the children property.

68
00:03:54,920 --> 00:03:58,790
When we append, it will go to the end of the children.

69
00:03:58,790 --> 00:04:00,710
So it will append down here.

70
00:04:02,250 --> 00:04:04,980
We should see it show up after broccoli.

71
00:04:06,230 --> 00:04:07,240
And do we?

72
00:04:07,250 --> 00:04:07,990
There it is.

73
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,140
I like animals.

74
00:04:09,140 --> 00:04:13,610
If we look at our HTML in the elements tab, scroll down.

75
00:04:13,610 --> 00:04:16,700
We have a section, the UL that was already there.

76
00:04:16,700 --> 00:04:20,060
It's now joined by a new sibling this h two.

77
00:04:20,990 --> 00:04:22,670
Let's do a couple more examples.

78
00:04:22,850 --> 00:04:28,510
We also have the ability to make all sorts of different elements, so why don't we try making an image?

79
00:04:28,520 --> 00:04:31,940
So I have an image URL I'll use here from Unsplash.

80
00:04:31,940 --> 00:04:33,440
We'll make our new image.

81
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:37,250
So const new image equals document.

82
00:04:37,670 --> 00:04:40,100
Dot create element.

83
00:04:41,810 --> 00:04:43,970
And we pass in image.

84
00:04:44,930 --> 00:04:48,170
And if I just do that and I run my code again.

85
00:04:48,940 --> 00:04:50,620
Let's take a look at new image.

86
00:04:51,370 --> 00:04:52,300
Same thing.

87
00:04:52,540 --> 00:04:55,240
Console deer image.

88
00:04:55,240 --> 00:04:56,140
New image.

89
00:04:57,730 --> 00:04:58,720
We can see that.

90
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:02,860
It's also an object, of course, for making a new element, but it has a different type.

91
00:05:02,860 --> 00:05:06,580
It's an HTML image element, so it behaves differently.

92
00:05:06,580 --> 00:05:08,080
We don't have inner text.

93
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:13,420
We don't work with inner HTML because an image does not have an opening and closing tag, but it does

94
00:05:13,420 --> 00:05:14,110
have a source.

95
00:05:14,110 --> 00:05:15,460
So let's set the source.

96
00:05:15,940 --> 00:05:19,930
New image source equals and I'll copy this URL I have.

97
00:05:19,960 --> 00:05:24,760
You could put any URL there and now let's append it somewhere.

98
00:05:25,210 --> 00:05:30,070
If we call a pen child again on the section, it will go inside of the section.

99
00:05:30,220 --> 00:05:35,620
If we don't want to append it to the inside of the section, I just want it to go at the end of my body.

100
00:05:36,130 --> 00:05:41,650
I guess it would go after the script, which maybe isn't ideal, but what I could do is use the body

101
00:05:41,650 --> 00:05:46,570
and call a pen child on the body, or I could put it inside the form.

102
00:05:46,570 --> 00:05:53,170
But let's do document, dot, body, dot, append, child, and then we pass in our image.

103
00:05:54,940 --> 00:05:57,760
Documents bodyguard, a child of new image.

104
00:05:58,120 --> 00:06:00,100
It's quite a large image.

105
00:06:00,250 --> 00:06:01,060
Oh, boy.

106
00:06:01,390 --> 00:06:02,140
Very large.

107
00:06:02,140 --> 00:06:03,160
But there it is.

108
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:05,770
So we could also give it an inline style.

109
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:08,650
Say new image, dot style.

110
00:06:09,190 --> 00:06:12,640
Dot width equals 200 pixels.

111
00:06:12,640 --> 00:06:13,720
Refresh again.

112
00:06:13,870 --> 00:06:14,860
Much smaller.

113
00:06:14,860 --> 00:06:15,990
Much more manageable.

114
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,150
Maybe even a bit larger.

115
00:06:17,170 --> 00:06:18,160
How about 300?

116
00:06:18,820 --> 00:06:21,000
So this process is really common.

117
00:06:21,010 --> 00:06:23,530
We make a new empty element of some type.

118
00:06:23,530 --> 00:06:25,150
It's always going to start out empty.

119
00:06:25,150 --> 00:06:27,520
And then we fill in the blanks when appropriate.

120
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:29,500
We fill in inner text if we need to.

121
00:06:29,530 --> 00:06:33,910
We fill in source or ref or classes.

122
00:06:33,910 --> 00:06:36,160
We add an attribute so we can do whatever we want.

123
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:37,720
So here's one more example.

124
00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:40,390
I have a link for a YouTube video.

125
00:06:40,510 --> 00:06:42,310
Let's make a new anchor tag.

126
00:06:42,370 --> 00:06:47,080
So I'm going to copy my URL just so I can use it and we'll do content.

127
00:06:47,140 --> 00:06:55,180
New link equals document dot create element of an anchor tag.

128
00:06:55,180 --> 00:06:56,170
That's the type.

129
00:06:56,500 --> 00:06:58,780
And then we'll set the inner text.

130
00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:03,190
Not HTML, but inner text.

131
00:07:03,220 --> 00:07:06,430
Let's go with Mr. Bubs video.

132
00:07:06,430 --> 00:07:08,230
So that's the name of the video.

133
00:07:09,610 --> 00:07:11,130
Wrong place for that period.

134
00:07:11,140 --> 00:07:12,040
Mr. Period.

135
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:17,500
Bob's video click me and then we want to set the source.

136
00:07:17,500 --> 00:07:22,420
Know the age ref sources for an image for a link and anchor tag.

137
00:07:22,420 --> 00:07:23,500
We want h ref.

138
00:07:24,570 --> 00:07:27,060
And then let's append it to the page somewhere.

139
00:07:27,570 --> 00:07:35,310
How about we select the paragraph, maybe the first paragraph, and we'll add it inside the first paragraph.

140
00:07:35,580 --> 00:07:42,990
So content first p equals document dot query selector p tag.

141
00:07:44,350 --> 00:07:49,840
First P dot append child of new link.

142
00:07:50,900 --> 00:07:51,980
Fingers crossed.

143
00:07:53,250 --> 00:07:53,550
There.

144
00:07:53,550 --> 00:07:55,230
We have a new link right here.

145
00:07:55,530 --> 00:07:59,220
It was appended as a child of this existing paragraph.

146
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:03,870
If we click it, by the way, it does open up our YouTube video.

147
00:08:04,530 --> 00:08:06,950
So that's the basics of creating elements.

148
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:09,150
You can create them of any different type.

149
00:08:09,150 --> 00:08:11,670
You can fill them with content, enter text.

150
00:08:11,670 --> 00:08:13,980
You can even use inner HTML if you wanted to.

151
00:08:14,010 --> 00:08:21,030
You could even append other elements into each element so we could create an anchor tag and then create

152
00:08:21,030 --> 00:08:28,170
a new empty span or a bold tag and append that to the new link and then take that in, append it to

153
00:08:28,170 --> 00:08:29,250
first paragraph.

154
00:08:29,550 --> 00:08:31,290
So we're not done with creating elements.

155
00:08:31,290 --> 00:08:32,990
We'll actually get a little more practice.

156
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:36,090
We're going to build a little example, something slightly more complex.

157
00:08:36,090 --> 00:08:40,740
And I'm also going to show you a few more methods where instead of appending at the end of something,

158
00:08:40,740 --> 00:08:45,480
what if you want to insert at the beginning the first child of an element instead of the last?

159
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:46,920
So that's coming up next.

160
00:08:47,220 --> 00:08:52,390
Oh, and if you've never seen this video, oh, Mr. Bubbs is quite the character here.

161
00:08:52,500 --> 00:08:54,900
He's a very special dog.

162
00:08:55,620 --> 00:09:02,270
He does not like not like love and attention or he has an odd way of showing it, but this is my favourite.

163
00:09:02,280 --> 00:09:03,510
Okay, here we go.

164
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:05,130
Yeah, I got you.

165
00:09:05,280 --> 00:09:09,830
I got this on camera anyway.

166
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:11,520
All right, back to Dom stuff.
