1
00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:04,410
Next up, we'll see a much better way to add multiple styles at once.

2
00:00:04,830 --> 00:00:09,020
So if we go back to our code here, I'm going to make a couple of revisions.

3
00:00:09,030 --> 00:00:10,470
I'm going to get rid of this hover style.

4
00:00:10,470 --> 00:00:13,350
It's quite janky and we have all these lies.

5
00:00:13,350 --> 00:00:15,900
Why don't we make a fake to do list?

6
00:00:15,900 --> 00:00:18,270
So I'm going to just add in some content.

7
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:21,060
We'll do it maybe here before the form.

8
00:00:21,060 --> 00:00:28,620
So I'll add in a UL and a couple of lies and the first thing I'll do is on the UL, I'll add an ID of

9
00:00:28,620 --> 00:00:30,330
how about to dos?

10
00:00:30,660 --> 00:00:33,450
And then I'll have a bunch of lies.

11
00:00:33,480 --> 00:00:41,190
Each one will have a class of to do single to do not to dos, the UL will have to dos as the class and

12
00:00:41,190 --> 00:00:42,870
then we'll just have some basic to dos.

13
00:00:42,870 --> 00:00:44,400
I know it's not very exciting.

14
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:49,500
Let's go with mow the lawn and then a couple more things.

15
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:53,910
Maybe milk the cows and what's one more?

16
00:00:53,910 --> 00:00:56,490
Feed the alpacas.

17
00:00:56,490 --> 00:00:57,390
Alpacas.

18
00:00:57,660 --> 00:01:02,190
And then let's also add in a checkbox next to each one of these.

19
00:01:02,310 --> 00:01:04,980
So I think I'm going to make my I'm going to revise this.

20
00:01:04,980 --> 00:01:05,820
I've changed my mind.

21
00:01:05,820 --> 00:01:06,600
I'll fast forward.

22
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:07,530
I'll show you what I do.

23
00:01:07,530 --> 00:01:07,920
Okay.

24
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:14,340
So I have three allies, each of the class of to do and I've added a button inside with just an X as

25
00:01:14,340 --> 00:01:15,030
the text.

26
00:01:15,030 --> 00:01:16,230
This is what we get.

27
00:01:16,260 --> 00:01:21,360
Three different buttons, three different allies, and they all have a class of to do so.

28
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:28,500
Now I'm going to add some basic styles to my to do class I'll select to do and why don't we do font

29
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:32,340
size slightly increased so maybe 30 pixels.

30
00:01:32,700 --> 00:01:33,930
Let's see how that looks.

31
00:01:34,530 --> 00:01:35,070
Okay.

32
00:01:35,070 --> 00:01:39,510
And I'll give them a color of olive and why don't we just start there?

33
00:01:39,540 --> 00:01:39,980
Okay.

34
00:01:39,990 --> 00:01:42,510
So I have my three to dos here, each with a button.

35
00:01:42,630 --> 00:01:48,870
Now, if I wanted to add some styles to mimic the crossing off of one of these to dos, I want to turn

36
00:01:48,870 --> 00:01:49,500
it gray.

37
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:50,790
So change the color.

38
00:01:50,820 --> 00:01:57,390
I want to add a line through effect, which is the text decoration property in case maybe I want to

39
00:01:57,390 --> 00:02:00,420
shrink it down so it takes up less space.

40
00:02:00,420 --> 00:02:06,840
Maybe change the opacity, different things that I could do if I want to do all of those at once to

41
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:12,120
mimic what happens when you click here or you click on a checkbox which doesn't exist right now with

42
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:17,160
what we know, it's totally possible we could do a query selector to grab the very first one.

43
00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:24,360
Let's get that first to do, which is inside of the to dos ID and I'll just get extra specific.

44
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:30,990
We could just do this, but I'm going to get extra fancy so that we select the first to do class inside

45
00:02:30,990 --> 00:02:33,240
of the to dos ID element.

46
00:02:33,270 --> 00:02:41,370
I'll save that to a variable cost to do equals and then I can go to work applying one style at a time

47
00:02:41,370 --> 00:02:45,930
to do style color equals and I'll change it to gray.

48
00:02:45,930 --> 00:02:50,130
So e a let's see, is that working?

49
00:02:50,490 --> 00:02:55,050
Okay, so it is gray now to give it text decoration, it's the same thing.

50
00:02:55,050 --> 00:03:02,910
I just have to pay attention to camel casing and then the property name or the value is line through.

51
00:03:03,950 --> 00:03:04,670
Well, refresh.

52
00:03:04,700 --> 00:03:05,460
Is that working?

53
00:03:05,480 --> 00:03:05,810
Yep.

54
00:03:05,810 --> 00:03:07,170
We get our line through.

55
00:03:07,190 --> 00:03:15,710
And why don't we also change the opacity to do style opacity equals and maybe 50%.

56
00:03:16,340 --> 00:03:17,630
Is that going to work for us?

57
00:03:18,140 --> 00:03:18,530
Okay.

58
00:03:18,530 --> 00:03:20,960
So now it is extra see through.

59
00:03:21,380 --> 00:03:27,170
I also could have just done an Reba color, but this is better because we have three properties and

60
00:03:27,170 --> 00:03:30,280
as you can see, it's three separate lines, one per property.

61
00:03:30,290 --> 00:03:35,930
And imagine we want to apply 20 different properties, radical changes to one of these elements.

62
00:03:36,140 --> 00:03:38,060
This is not very ideal.

63
00:03:38,090 --> 00:03:39,300
It's not good at all.

64
00:03:39,320 --> 00:03:40,670
So what is the solution?

65
00:03:40,670 --> 00:03:42,890
What's the best way of achieving this?

66
00:03:43,070 --> 00:03:44,620
Using a class.

67
00:03:44,630 --> 00:03:47,210
So we define a class in our CSS.

68
00:03:47,300 --> 00:03:50,990
We could call it completed or finished or how about done?

69
00:03:52,100 --> 00:03:54,370
And we'll set color to be gray.

70
00:03:54,800 --> 00:04:02,660
We'll set text decoration to be line through, and we'll set opacity to be 50%.

71
00:04:03,050 --> 00:04:08,820
So now we have this class that the element does not have, but we can selectively apply it.

72
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:11,840
So I'm going to comment out the individual lines.

73
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:15,590
And now let's apply that class to apply the class.

74
00:04:15,590 --> 00:04:18,279
We've actually already seen one way of working with the class.

75
00:04:18,290 --> 00:04:20,339
I think I have my to do over here.

76
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:20,750
Yeah.

77
00:04:20,750 --> 00:04:22,100
So I selected it here.

78
00:04:22,100 --> 00:04:23,960
I'm just accessing it in the console.

79
00:04:24,410 --> 00:04:31,940
We can use get attribute class is an attribute so I can retrieve the current class and I get to do.

80
00:04:32,820 --> 00:04:34,680
I could set attribute.

81
00:04:36,740 --> 00:04:43,130
Like this set attribute class and then give it the class name I want to add or I want to use to set

82
00:04:43,130 --> 00:04:43,940
the class.

83
00:04:44,270 --> 00:04:46,190
And we called it done, right.

84
00:04:46,190 --> 00:04:46,760
Done.

85
00:04:46,760 --> 00:04:47,300
Yep.

86
00:04:47,570 --> 00:04:50,330
So I can do this and it works.

87
00:04:50,330 --> 00:04:52,160
Our styles are applied.

88
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:58,180
But if we look at what happened and you can see here the font size changed, that to do has lost the

89
00:04:58,190 --> 00:05:04,850
to do class, it has the done class, which is what we wanted, but we completely overrode the to do

90
00:05:04,850 --> 00:05:05,450
class.

91
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:06,920
So not ideal.

92
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:10,070
That's the downside of using set attribute.

93
00:05:10,190 --> 00:05:16,130
Set attribute just takes this value here and automatically replaces the current class.

94
00:05:16,430 --> 00:05:23,330
So I could do this to do space done to apply to classes and that works.

95
00:05:23,330 --> 00:05:27,230
But that requires me to hard code in what I'm trying to achieve.

96
00:05:27,260 --> 00:05:28,130
What are the classes?

97
00:05:28,130 --> 00:05:33,980
If I have five different classes on one element and all I want to do is add the done class, this is

98
00:05:33,980 --> 00:05:35,180
not the best approach.

99
00:05:35,390 --> 00:05:40,820
So this brings us to a new property we haven't seen called Class List.

100
00:05:40,820 --> 00:05:44,510
Now class list is an object representation.

101
00:05:44,510 --> 00:05:46,280
It's called a DOM token list.

102
00:05:46,280 --> 00:05:48,380
It kind of looks like an array, but it's not.

103
00:05:48,380 --> 00:05:52,400
And it contains the classes that we have on this element.

104
00:05:52,520 --> 00:05:56,510
And it's not just about containing the classes or allowing us to see them.

105
00:05:56,510 --> 00:05:59,570
It also provides methods so that we can do things.

106
00:05:59,570 --> 00:06:06,290
If we open this up, we have a ADD method, we have a contained method, we've got what else do we have

107
00:06:06,290 --> 00:06:07,130
a toggle method.

108
00:06:07,130 --> 00:06:11,300
That one's really useful and I can call these on the class list.

109
00:06:11,630 --> 00:06:18,500
So let's cover up the left side of the screen and pretend we don't know if the To-Do currently has the

110
00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:20,150
done class or not.

111
00:06:20,450 --> 00:06:23,000
So we can still see it there.

112
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:23,570
It's gone.

113
00:06:23,570 --> 00:06:29,060
We don't know if it has it or not, and I want to make sure that it does not have it.

114
00:06:29,060 --> 00:06:30,200
I want to remove it.

115
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:37,460
The easiest way is to do class list, dot remove and then pass in the class name.

116
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:41,650
And if we scroll up, it's gone.

117
00:06:41,890 --> 00:06:44,530
If I try and remove it again, no problem.

118
00:06:44,920 --> 00:06:48,970
So this is already a nicer improvement using set attribute.

119
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,980
I can't just say remove this one part.

120
00:06:50,980 --> 00:06:57,730
I have to say here is the entire new class string containing all the old classes I want and not containing

121
00:06:57,730 --> 00:06:58,330
done.

122
00:06:58,510 --> 00:07:02,020
But if I do it this way, I can just say get rid of done if it's there.

123
00:07:02,110 --> 00:07:03,520
Or it could go the opposite.

124
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:08,290
I could do to do list dot add and it will add done.

125
00:07:08,500 --> 00:07:12,190
And if it's there already, it's not going to keep adding it if we look.

126
00:07:13,030 --> 00:07:14,440
It just has one done.

127
00:07:14,440 --> 00:07:18,960
But perhaps the most useful part is the ability to toggle a class.

128
00:07:18,970 --> 00:07:21,460
So if it's there already, then remove it.

129
00:07:21,460 --> 00:07:23,230
If it's not there, add it.

130
00:07:23,410 --> 00:07:26,800
And we have a method called toggle to do just that.

131
00:07:27,340 --> 00:07:28,960
Toggle done.

132
00:07:30,890 --> 00:07:32,510
So it's removed now.

133
00:07:32,510 --> 00:07:33,980
It's added removed.

134
00:07:33,980 --> 00:07:35,870
Added over and over and over.

135
00:07:36,350 --> 00:07:37,190
Pretty good.

136
00:07:37,370 --> 00:07:38,390
So this is useful.

137
00:07:38,390 --> 00:07:44,390
If we were to rewrite this ourselves without class list and that method, it would be kind of annoying.

138
00:07:44,390 --> 00:07:46,740
We would have to access to do that.

139
00:07:46,790 --> 00:07:53,630
Get attribute class and then do maybe dot includes done.

140
00:07:55,770 --> 00:07:57,750
And figure out if that's true or false.

141
00:07:57,750 --> 00:08:00,810
So if it's false, then we want to add in done.

142
00:08:00,810 --> 00:08:07,650
So we would do to do set attributes class and then we would take the current value.

143
00:08:07,650 --> 00:08:17,400
So to do that, get attributes class and then we would add into that done.

144
00:08:18,300 --> 00:08:19,620
This is quite janky.

145
00:08:19,620 --> 00:08:25,710
So we're saying I want to set attribute, I want to set class to be the current value of it, plus the

146
00:08:25,710 --> 00:08:26,670
string done.

147
00:08:27,470 --> 00:08:33,020
And now we look at to do that, get attribute class.

148
00:08:34,020 --> 00:08:34,890
That works.

149
00:08:34,890 --> 00:08:40,350
And then if I wanted to toggle it again, I could do to do get attribute class that includes done now

150
00:08:40,350 --> 00:08:41,070
it's true.

151
00:08:41,070 --> 00:08:44,820
So I would want to remove done and use that attribute.

152
00:08:44,820 --> 00:08:45,870
It's a nightmare to have to do it.

153
00:08:45,870 --> 00:08:48,300
Well, nightmare is maybe an overstatement.

154
00:08:48,300 --> 00:08:51,990
It's not great, but if we use toggle, it's super easy.

155
00:08:52,260 --> 00:08:53,970
We don't have to care if it's there or not.

156
00:08:53,970 --> 00:08:55,770
We just say Toggle it, flip it.

157
00:08:55,770 --> 00:08:57,030
If it's there, remove it.

158
00:08:57,030 --> 00:09:00,690
If it's not there, add it and notice that it does return true or false.

159
00:09:00,810 --> 00:09:05,910
So if the class is currently not applied right now done is not applied.

160
00:09:05,910 --> 00:09:10,530
If I toggle it and it adds it in, it returns true.

161
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:16,050
If the class is already there and I'm trying to toggle it again, it returns false when it removes that

162
00:09:16,050 --> 00:09:16,680
class.

163
00:09:16,860 --> 00:09:23,400
So to summarize the class list, it's a really, really nice property we have access to because we actually

164
00:09:23,400 --> 00:09:26,400
apply and remove and toggle classes all the time.

165
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:29,640
We saw the downsides of applying styles one at a time.

166
00:09:29,670 --> 00:09:33,330
It's annoying for one thing to have to type them on different lines.

167
00:09:33,330 --> 00:09:39,060
We have to pay attention to camel casing and also our styles end up all in our JavaScript.

168
00:09:39,090 --> 00:09:44,910
We're writing basically a stylesheet right here versus if we did it this way with a class, we keep

169
00:09:44,910 --> 00:09:46,080
all of our styles together.

170
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:49,650
We write them one time, we put them in the actual CSS file.

171
00:09:49,650 --> 00:09:53,280
So it has all of our CSS and we just pick a name for the class.

172
00:09:53,280 --> 00:09:59,460
And then from our JavaScript we can selectively apply and remove and toggle that class so we can do

173
00:09:59,460 --> 00:10:05,970
it all in a batch one line right here, and in our case it adds three different styles, but we could

174
00:10:05,970 --> 00:10:07,920
have 100 styles in one class.

175
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:13,500
So this is generally the better approach to change styles using JavaScript unless you are just changing

176
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:15,480
one thing, you want to change the color.

177
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:16,320
It's a one off.

178
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:16,770
I don't know.

179
00:10:16,770 --> 00:10:19,680
You just want to make something green or you want to change the font size.

180
00:10:19,710 --> 00:10:23,820
You want to hide something one time, then go ahead and use the style property.

181
00:10:23,820 --> 00:10:29,070
But if you're doing multiple styles at once or you plan on reusing this and styling multiple elements

182
00:10:29,070 --> 00:10:34,620
the same way, create a class and add or remove it using the class list property and its methods.
