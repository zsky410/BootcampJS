1
00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:06,540
Next up, we'll see two methods not properties, but methods called get attribute and set attribute.

2
00:00:06,540 --> 00:00:09,170
And these methods do exactly what they sound like.

3
00:00:09,180 --> 00:00:13,620
They allow us to access or change the value of attributes on elements.

4
00:00:13,620 --> 00:00:18,000
So we've seen a couple shorthand or shortcut ways to access attributes.

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:25,230
Some special cases like value or placeholder or source or ref that are commonly used have their own

6
00:00:25,230 --> 00:00:28,320
shortcut property, but there are other attributes that don't.

7
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:34,920
So we have these methods get attribute and set attribute, for example, on this range input right here,

8
00:00:35,460 --> 00:00:39,900
if I select it const, I'll select using a query selector.

9
00:00:39,900 --> 00:00:45,750
So I'll do const range equals, document dot, query selector.

10
00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:54,930
And I don't want to just do input, I'm going to do input and then attribute type equals after use the

11
00:00:54,930 --> 00:00:58,950
right quotes in here type equals range and I'll expand it a bit.

12
00:00:59,810 --> 00:01:05,480
So give me the first input where it has the type attribute set to range and we have that range.

13
00:01:05,480 --> 00:01:08,210
And if we look at it, where are you?

14
00:01:08,210 --> 00:01:08,930
Right here.

15
00:01:08,930 --> 00:01:10,610
We have a bunch of attributes.

16
00:01:10,610 --> 00:01:14,630
We have the type attribute, we have men, we have Macs, we have step.

17
00:01:14,930 --> 00:01:22,400
So if I want to know what the max value is for this range, I could do range dot and then the get attribute

18
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:28,340
method which takes the name of an attribute as a string and I'll type max and I get 500.

19
00:01:28,730 --> 00:01:31,100
If I do min, I get 100.

20
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:34,700
I could also view the type attribute and get range.

21
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,380
So that's get attribute.

22
00:01:36,440 --> 00:01:37,100
It's simple.

23
00:01:37,100 --> 00:01:41,780
You pass it in the attribute you're looking for on the element that you're calling it on and it gives

24
00:01:41,780 --> 00:01:44,150
you the value, assuming it has that attribute.

25
00:01:44,150 --> 00:01:48,950
If I try and find an attribute that's not in there like lol, it just gives me null.

26
00:01:49,490 --> 00:01:51,590
Now we can also use set attribute.

27
00:01:51,590 --> 00:01:55,340
So range set attribute takes two arguments.

28
00:01:55,340 --> 00:02:00,620
The thing we're trying to set, so I'll do min and then the value I want to give it.

29
00:02:00,650 --> 00:02:04,130
Let's say the men is -500.

30
00:02:04,980 --> 00:02:05,580
Okay.

31
00:02:06,780 --> 00:02:13,560
Now, if we look in our HTML or in the Elements tab and we inspect that input, we should see that now

32
00:02:13,590 --> 00:02:15,210
min is -500.

33
00:02:15,540 --> 00:02:21,420
And if we play around with the range, let's go all the way down here and take a look at range value,

34
00:02:21,420 --> 00:02:22,530
which we just saw.

35
00:02:23,430 --> 00:02:25,950
It's now -350.

36
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:28,950
So we are successfully setting that attribute.

37
00:02:28,980 --> 00:02:31,260
It's one that we don't really have a shortcut for.

38
00:02:31,290 --> 00:02:32,880
We have a shortcut for value.

39
00:02:32,910 --> 00:02:36,810
We had one for source on an image and a ref on an anchor tag.

40
00:02:36,810 --> 00:02:42,150
But there are plenty of attributes you may need to change where you need to use set attribute.

41
00:02:42,450 --> 00:02:43,830
So that's a couple of examples.

42
00:02:43,830 --> 00:02:46,600
We also could change the entire type of the input.

43
00:02:46,620 --> 00:02:54,790
I could do range, dot, set attribute and then do type, and then we could turn it into a radio button.

44
00:02:54,810 --> 00:02:55,380
Sure.

45
00:02:55,410 --> 00:02:56,670
Type equals radio.

46
00:02:57,180 --> 00:02:59,280
And now we have a radio button there.

47
00:03:00,030 --> 00:03:02,490
So we completely change the type of the input.

48
00:03:02,490 --> 00:03:06,480
The variable is still called range, but it's no longer an actual range input.

49
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:09,450
So that's get attribute and set attribute.

50
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:12,390
There are plenty of other attributes we could use with this.

51
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:15,430
Most of the common ones have those short hands that we saw.

52
00:03:15,450 --> 00:03:19,770
But if there's ever something you need to change, I mean, technically you could use set attribute

53
00:03:19,770 --> 00:03:20,820
to change an ID.

54
00:03:20,850 --> 00:03:25,740
So if there's ever an attribute that you need to update or that you need to access, these are your

55
00:03:25,740 --> 00:03:29,940
go to methods get and set attribute relatively straightforward.
