00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:06,000
Next up, there is a shortcut syntax that you can use in JavaScript for certain conditionals.

2
00:00:06,030 --> 00:00:07,890
It's called the ternary operator.

3
00:00:07,920 --> 00:00:13,830
It's a way of basically taking an IFF and an else and turning them into a single line of code.

4
00:00:14,130 --> 00:00:19,410
It's called the ternary operator because there are three pieces instead of binary.

5
00:00:19,440 --> 00:00:21,240
Ternary is the term for three.

6
00:00:21,660 --> 00:00:23,910
As you can see, there are three pieces here.

7
00:00:24,120 --> 00:00:27,000
This is kind of the template for how you would read it.

8
00:00:27,030 --> 00:00:29,790
There's a condition and a question mark.

9
00:00:29,910 --> 00:00:34,020
So if this condition is true, this code runs.

10
00:00:34,380 --> 00:00:37,620
Otherwise, if it was false, this code runs.

11
00:00:38,010 --> 00:00:39,810
So let's take a simple example.

12
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:44,730
Remember, this only works if you're doing a simple yes or no and if and an else.

13
00:00:44,730 --> 00:00:46,560
So no else ifs involved.

14
00:00:46,740 --> 00:00:55,450
Let's say we have a number let num equal seven and if num is equal to seven, we'll console.log.

15
00:00:55,470 --> 00:00:56,220
Lucky.

16
00:00:58,550 --> 00:01:04,489
And then else we can control that log bad.

17
00:01:05,850 --> 00:01:12,560
Okay, so here we have a simple if and an else we could rewrite this entire thing on one line if you

18
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:13,190
wanted to.

19
00:01:13,220 --> 00:01:16,730
Using this syntax, we have condition question mark.

20
00:01:16,730 --> 00:01:20,660
So the condition is num equals seven question mark.

21
00:01:20,690 --> 00:01:22,420
Then the code we want to run.

22
00:01:22,430 --> 00:01:25,460
If true, that will go there.

23
00:01:27,310 --> 00:01:31,930
And then the code we want to run, if false, is separated by a colon.

24
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:34,060
So a question mark and then a colon.

25
00:01:35,060 --> 00:01:39,380
Colon contact log bat just like that.

26
00:01:39,410 --> 00:01:43,500
I'll comment out the original code, refresh the page and it still works.

27
00:01:43,550 --> 00:01:44,510
We get lucky.

28
00:01:44,540 --> 00:01:46,040
Let's change it to two.

29
00:01:47,870 --> 00:01:48,980
We don't get lucky.

30
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:50,010
Okay.

31
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:51,290
Back to seven.

32
00:01:52,830 --> 00:01:56,680
So we've taken this logic and just written written it as a single line.

33
00:01:56,700 --> 00:01:58,950
That doesn't mean that you should always do this.

34
00:01:59,220 --> 00:02:03,710
Even this is getting pretty long for a ternary, mainly because of these consort logs.

35
00:02:03,720 --> 00:02:09,539
But I'll show you another example, slightly different, where we could actually use the ternary operator

36
00:02:09,539 --> 00:02:11,850
to assign a value to a variable.

37
00:02:11,910 --> 00:02:17,670
Let's say we're making a chat app where you can set yourself, you can set a status to be online or

38
00:02:17,670 --> 00:02:18,360
offline.

39
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:21,330
So we'll have a status variable and set it.

40
00:02:21,690 --> 00:02:23,370
Let's go with offline to start.

41
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:29,160
And then we want to have a color that we use to show like a little bubble next to your name.

42
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:33,180
If this is a chat app, a bubble that is either red or green.

43
00:02:33,180 --> 00:02:39,420
So it's red if you're offline and green if you're online, we would have a variable like color.

44
00:02:39,780 --> 00:02:42,600
And if we did it without a ternary operator, we would do.

45
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:55,710
If status equals offline, then we would make color equal to red and then less color is equal to green.

46
00:02:56,400 --> 00:03:00,750
So we could write it this way or we could do it all in one line.

47
00:03:00,810 --> 00:03:04,260
So I'll keep that there, but I'm going to comment it out.

48
00:03:05,190 --> 00:03:10,080
We could rewrite it as let color equals and then our ternary operator.

49
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:16,620
So the piece of logic is status equals offline question mark.

50
00:03:16,950 --> 00:03:19,350
Then one value would be red.

51
00:03:19,350 --> 00:03:20,850
That's the true part.

52
00:03:20,970 --> 00:03:25,110
Remember condition expression if true expression if false.

53
00:03:25,110 --> 00:03:29,070
So if true we want red, otherwise we want green.

54
00:03:30,090 --> 00:03:33,360
And now we've rewritten this entire thing in one line.

55
00:03:33,570 --> 00:03:35,730
So this is a pretty common use case.

56
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:38,550
If I run it, we get red for color.

57
00:03:38,700 --> 00:03:44,700
If I change this to be online or really anything else we're only checking for offline at this point.

58
00:03:45,150 --> 00:03:50,430
We'll see that color is now green, so it's a nice shortcut.

59
00:03:50,430 --> 00:03:54,540
It can be kind of odd if you're not familiar with it, which is why I wanted to show it to you.

60
00:03:54,540 --> 00:03:58,590
Now, while we're talking about conditionals, it doesn't do anything new.

61
00:03:58,590 --> 00:04:00,690
It just can shorten your code up.

62
00:04:00,690 --> 00:04:02,220
So here is the original.

63
00:04:02,250 --> 00:04:04,320
Here is the second version with ternary.

64
00:04:04,320 --> 00:04:10,290
Operator We have a condition question mark something that happens if the condition is true and something

65
00:04:10,290 --> 00:04:12,150
that happens if the condition is false.

66
00:04:12,150 --> 00:04:15,090
So the if and the else, that's it.

67
00:04:15,090 --> 00:04:16,140
There's no room for else.

68
00:04:16,140 --> 00:04:19,200
If it's just a yes or no, do this or do this.
