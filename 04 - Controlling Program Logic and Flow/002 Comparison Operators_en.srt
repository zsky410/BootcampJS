1
00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:00,720
All right.

2
00:00:00,720 --> 00:00:01,810
Let's jump right in.

3
00:00:01,830 --> 00:00:03,660
We're going to start with comparisons.

4
00:00:03,660 --> 00:00:08,070
Being able to compare values is really important when making decisions.

5
00:00:08,189 --> 00:00:14,100
As a really simple example, something like The New York Times or any website where you get a certain

6
00:00:14,100 --> 00:00:19,230
number of free articles a month, they track the number of articles you've read each month when you're

7
00:00:19,230 --> 00:00:23,820
not logged in, and then they have a maximum, whether it's ten or five, they're going to check.

8
00:00:23,850 --> 00:00:25,820
Has this user seen more?

9
00:00:25,830 --> 00:00:29,340
Have they seen fewer than the allotted or the allowed number?

10
00:00:29,610 --> 00:00:31,440
So that's a comparison we're checking.

11
00:00:31,440 --> 00:00:34,200
Is one value less than another value?

12
00:00:34,620 --> 00:00:40,200
Other comparisons that are really common would be things like equality, checking to see if something

13
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:41,480
equals something else.

14
00:00:41,490 --> 00:00:46,360
So this is a list of the different comparison operations we have in JavaScript.

15
00:00:46,380 --> 00:00:52,080
There's quite a few, but there's a lot of overlap and we're going to skip over the bottom for those.

16
00:00:52,080 --> 00:00:58,100
All have to do with equality, not equality, strict equality, strict non equality.

17
00:00:58,110 --> 00:01:03,690
We're just going to focus on the first for greater than, less than, greater than or equal to and less

18
00:01:03,690 --> 00:01:05,069
than or equal to.

19
00:01:05,430 --> 00:01:06,870
So let's play around with them.

20
00:01:06,990 --> 00:01:10,830
I'll show you a couple of examples over here in my console.

21
00:01:10,860 --> 00:01:12,320
Let's try something like.

22
00:01:12,330 --> 00:01:15,810
Is negative to greater than one.

23
00:01:16,770 --> 00:01:21,270
You can see we get a boolean back, a false boolean value.

24
00:01:21,330 --> 00:01:23,640
Remember Booleans are just two options.

25
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:24,720
True or false?

26
00:01:24,750 --> 00:01:32,190
Every single one of these operators we see here, all of these on this page return true or false one

27
00:01:32,190 --> 00:01:33,030
or the other.

28
00:01:33,630 --> 00:01:35,010
So that is greater.

29
00:01:35,010 --> 00:01:43,050
Then we can also do less than we have things like is ten less than 9999 without that period.

30
00:01:43,050 --> 00:01:43,730
There we go.

31
00:01:43,740 --> 00:01:44,850
That is true.

32
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:47,490
Ten is smaller than nine, nine, nine, nine.

33
00:01:47,820 --> 00:01:52,440
We also have things like less than or equal to and greater than or equal to.

34
00:01:52,470 --> 00:01:56,400
So we could do is to greater than or equal to two.

35
00:01:56,670 --> 00:01:57,720
That's true.

36
00:01:58,110 --> 00:02:00,330
Is to greater than or equal to five.

37
00:02:00,330 --> 00:02:03,660
That's false to greater than or equal to one.

38
00:02:03,930 --> 00:02:07,110
That is also true and less than or equal to.

39
00:02:07,110 --> 00:02:07,950
Finally.

40
00:02:08,729 --> 00:02:11,540
Hopefully these are relatively straightforward at this point.

41
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:19,350
Doesn't seem that useful on its own to just do something like 55.1 less than or equal to 55.5.

42
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:21,720
We know that we're typing it.

43
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:26,880
But just to let you know where we're going, we're learning these operators first, then we'll see how

44
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:28,350
we use them to make decisions.

45
00:02:28,350 --> 00:02:30,000
Right now, we're not deciding anything.

46
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,510
We're not changing the code that runs based off of these.

47
00:02:33,510 --> 00:02:36,570
We're simply evaluating these to be true or false.

48
00:02:36,570 --> 00:02:42,450
So most of the time when we do comparisons involving less than or greater than or less than or equal

49
00:02:42,450 --> 00:02:46,500
to, greater than or equal to, we're working with numbers in some form.

50
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:48,480
It might be the length of a string.

51
00:02:48,510 --> 00:02:49,650
It might be something like this.

52
00:02:49,650 --> 00:02:51,660
Hello length.

53
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:58,190
Greater than or equal to hello length.

54
00:03:00,900 --> 00:03:06,210
Usually those would be variables, but you can see this is false because this is actually larger.

55
00:03:06,210 --> 00:03:07,320
There's an exclamation point.

56
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:09,240
The length is longer than this one.

57
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:13,440
But the point is we're not usually just directly typing hardcoded values.

58
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:15,000
We know the answer already.

59
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:19,890
We're usually working with variables, things that are coming from a place that we're not controlling,

60
00:03:19,890 --> 00:03:22,320
where we don't exactly know the values.

61
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:25,290
So anyway, numbers are really common.

62
00:03:25,290 --> 00:03:32,310
When we're dealing with greater than and less, then we can compare strings and it's it's not that common.

63
00:03:32,310 --> 00:03:33,780
And you'll see why in a moment.

64
00:03:33,780 --> 00:03:39,660
The way that strings are ordered, it's not always the most intuitive, but I can give you a quick example.

65
00:03:39,780 --> 00:03:43,890
Let's start with lowercase a and compare it to uppercase A.

66
00:03:44,460 --> 00:03:51,960
So from this comparison we can see uppercase A is less than lowercase a, as you can see here.

67
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:54,510
Now what about Uppercase B?

68
00:03:54,510 --> 00:03:57,690
How does that compare to lowercase A?

69
00:03:58,200 --> 00:04:06,600
So Uppercase B comes before lowercase a, which is not really the standard alphabetical order most people

70
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:07,860
would assume.

71
00:04:08,010 --> 00:04:13,050
So all uppercase letters are less than any lowercase letters.

72
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:19,800
Then we also have confusing things like dollar signs and symbols and punctuation and accent marks.

73
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:21,029
Spaces.

74
00:04:21,029 --> 00:04:26,100
If you're curious how it works, what the algorithm is, or what the comparison is, actually behind

75
00:04:26,100 --> 00:04:29,220
the scenes, it has to do with something called Unicode.

76
00:04:29,700 --> 00:04:35,430
All that you need to know is that every character in JavaScript when it's in a string, has a Unicode

77
00:04:35,430 --> 00:04:40,170
representation, it has a number behind it, and you can see them here.

78
00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:48,720
There's a long, long article on Wikipedia that details all of the different codes per each letter character

79
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:49,440
symbol.

80
00:04:49,530 --> 00:04:55,050
So you can see, for example, the very first code, very first character is zero.

81
00:04:55,050 --> 00:05:00,900
And if we look at two other let's go with hash sign and dollar sign, we can see the hash sign comes

82
00:05:00,900 --> 00:05:02,310
before the dollar sign.

83
00:05:02,310 --> 00:05:07,860
So it should stand to reason that hash sign is less than dollar sign.

84
00:05:08,340 --> 00:05:09,420
And that's true.

85
00:05:10,630 --> 00:05:13,480
So this is not something you need to know and memorize.

86
00:05:13,510 --> 00:05:18,970
I just wanted to explain how it works because I've seen a lot of students just assume it's all alphabetical

87
00:05:18,970 --> 00:05:22,780
order, which would make sense if we were strictly dealing with letters.

88
00:05:22,780 --> 00:05:27,280
But when we deal with a whole bunch of other characters and symbols and accents and punctuation, it's

89
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:28,360
more complicated.

90
00:05:28,660 --> 00:05:33,610
So comparisons, at least the ones I've shown so far, are usually done between numbers.

91
00:05:33,610 --> 00:05:38,980
But we have this whole other group that we haven't talked about around equality and non equality.

92
00:05:38,980 --> 00:05:40,190
That's coming up next.

93
00:05:40,210 --> 00:05:41,020
I'll see you then.
