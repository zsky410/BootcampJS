1
00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:05,640
The next thing to know about conditionals is that we can nest them inside of one another so we can have

2
00:00:05,640 --> 00:00:11,460
multiple layers deep of conditionals where we're checking for a certain condition to be true and we

3
00:00:11,460 --> 00:00:16,260
can nest them as much as we want, whether it's if and elses, we can throw an else ifs.

4
00:00:16,260 --> 00:00:18,960
We just nest them inside the curly braces.

5
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:21,120
So let's try an example.

6
00:00:21,120 --> 00:00:24,750
We'll go with this example I've been using in the slides of a password.

7
00:00:25,290 --> 00:00:29,070
So let's say a user type, some password and we don't know what it is.

8
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:30,900
So that's going to be invalid.

9
00:00:30,900 --> 00:00:32,759
I'm just going to make it undefined for now.

10
00:00:33,390 --> 00:00:34,770
Let's say we don't know what it is.

11
00:00:34,770 --> 00:00:41,370
We want to make sure the password is long enough so we would check if password length is let's say it's

12
00:00:41,370 --> 00:00:45,780
greater than or equal to maybe six eight.

13
00:00:46,590 --> 00:00:47,700
Not super strong.

14
00:00:47,700 --> 00:00:53,760
It should be longer, but just to make our lives easier if it is greater than or equal to six, we'll

15
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:54,660
check something.

16
00:00:54,660 --> 00:00:57,600
If it's not, we'll console that log.

17
00:00:58,170 --> 00:00:59,790
Password must be longer.

18
00:01:02,370 --> 00:01:03,060
Great.

19
00:01:04,349 --> 00:01:07,420
But if it is greater than or equal to six, we're not done.

20
00:01:07,440 --> 00:01:12,660
We also want to make sure there's no spaces in a password so we could check if password.

21
00:01:12,810 --> 00:01:17,340
And the easiest way to check if there's a space anywhere in there, at least with what we know right

22
00:01:17,340 --> 00:01:21,480
now, would be to do an index of the space character.

23
00:01:21,480 --> 00:01:22,670
So that's not an empty string.

24
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:23,640
There's a space.

25
00:01:23,760 --> 00:01:30,180
And remember, if it is found in the string password, we'll get an index like two or seven or 20 or

26
00:01:30,180 --> 00:01:30,740
zero.

27
00:01:30,750 --> 00:01:33,780
If it's not found, we'll get negative one.

28
00:01:34,050 --> 00:01:37,710
So if we find negative one, that means there is a space.

29
00:01:37,950 --> 00:01:44,820
So if password index of space is equal to negative one, that means there is no space.

30
00:01:44,820 --> 00:01:46,740
We can then cancel that log.

31
00:01:47,160 --> 00:01:48,510
Valid password.

32
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:54,570
And then otherwise we can cancel that log.

33
00:01:55,590 --> 00:02:01,590
Password is long enough but cannot contain spaces.

34
00:02:02,130 --> 00:02:03,490
So let's test it out.

35
00:02:03,510 --> 00:02:05,140
Right now password is undefined.

36
00:02:05,160 --> 00:02:06,450
Let's give it a value.

37
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:09,960
Password will be a hello kitty.

38
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:11,580
So that is long enough.

39
00:02:11,580 --> 00:02:17,190
But if I refresh we see password is long enough but cannot contain spaces and there is at least one

40
00:02:17,190 --> 00:02:18,240
space in there.

41
00:02:18,570 --> 00:02:22,560
If I get rid of that refresh valid password.

42
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:26,670
Now, if I get rid of some of these characters, it's too short.

43
00:02:26,670 --> 00:02:28,560
We get password must be longer.

44
00:02:28,710 --> 00:02:34,050
So the main takeaway from this video should be that we can nest conditionals inside of other conditionals

45
00:02:34,050 --> 00:02:37,290
we could add in another else if somewhere.

46
00:02:37,770 --> 00:02:42,340
Although I don't really think I can't think of a good scenario, at least now with a password or an

47
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:43,680
else, if would make sense.

48
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:48,090
But we could continue to nest instead of else, instead of if.

49
00:02:48,090 --> 00:02:52,020
But there is a point where it becomes a little bit difficult to read.

50
00:02:52,020 --> 00:02:57,360
If your code is super nested and there are different solutions or strategies you can take to alleviate

51
00:02:57,360 --> 00:03:02,370
that, we're about to start learning one of them at least where something like this could actually be

52
00:03:02,370 --> 00:03:08,790
written as a single condition, because in order for a password to be valid, we need the length to

53
00:03:08,790 --> 00:03:12,060
be greater than six and we want there to be no spaces.

54
00:03:12,300 --> 00:03:13,530
That means it's valid.

55
00:03:13,530 --> 00:03:18,000
What if we could just write a single conditional that said, if it's long enough and there aren't spaces,

56
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:18,840
it's valid.

57
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:20,550
That's what we'll see how to do next.

58
00:03:20,550 --> 00:03:22,140
There's nothing wrong with nesting.

59
00:03:22,140 --> 00:03:27,570
Sometimes you cannot get around it, but you just don't want to have like five levels of nested conditionals,

60
00:03:27,570 --> 00:03:30,150
especially if they all have, if and else's.

61
00:03:30,150 --> 00:03:32,610
It just can be a bit of a headache to understand.

62
00:03:32,610 --> 00:03:33,630
So that's nesting.
