00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:00,910
Welcome back.

2
00:00:00,930 --> 00:00:05,700
We saw the first part of a conditional where we can write if and then a condition and some code will

3
00:00:05,700 --> 00:00:06,270
run.

4
00:00:06,420 --> 00:00:10,440
Next, we're going to talk about a second component, which is called elseif.

5
00:00:10,470 --> 00:00:14,160
You can think of ELSEIF as if the first condition was not true.

6
00:00:14,190 --> 00:00:16,239
Maybe this other thing will be true.

7
00:00:16,260 --> 00:00:21,000
It will only be attempted if the first part if the if was false.

8
00:00:21,780 --> 00:00:25,860
So if we try it out over here, I'm in a new file again.

9
00:00:25,860 --> 00:00:30,510
I kept my code from the last section or the last video where we're doing a performance review.

10
00:00:30,540 --> 00:00:32,330
Let's say this is our guide.

11
00:00:32,340 --> 00:00:35,880
If rating is three, that person is a superstar.

12
00:00:35,910 --> 00:00:39,480
If rating is two, they meet expectations.

13
00:00:39,750 --> 00:00:45,060
So with what we know right now, without else, if we could just write a second condition if rating

14
00:00:45,060 --> 00:00:53,040
equals equals to console.log, meet expectations like that.

15
00:00:53,040 --> 00:00:54,150
And this does work.

16
00:00:54,150 --> 00:00:58,760
If I make rating two, we'll only see meets expectations.

17
00:00:58,770 --> 00:01:02,010
But this is not the same thing as using an else.

18
00:01:02,010 --> 00:01:08,550
If if we have two separate ifs, there's certain scenarios where both of them could be true instead

19
00:01:08,550 --> 00:01:11,120
of checking if rating is equal to three.

20
00:01:11,130 --> 00:01:18,330
What if we said if it is, I don't know, equal to three and then this one was greater than or equal

21
00:01:18,330 --> 00:01:19,080
to two?

22
00:01:20,160 --> 00:01:25,650
If we change rating to three, both of these will be true and we end up with both of them.

23
00:01:25,650 --> 00:01:26,400
Print it out.

24
00:01:26,430 --> 00:01:32,310
Now, that's kind of an arbitrary example because in our case, rating is really just 3 to 1 or something

25
00:01:32,310 --> 00:01:32,910
else.

26
00:01:32,910 --> 00:01:36,090
But the point is, this is a different structure.

27
00:01:36,090 --> 00:01:37,890
We have two conditionals.

28
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:40,500
This one runs, if it's true, this code runs.

29
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:46,320
And regardless of whether this one actually worked, if this was true or not, the second one will be

30
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:47,130
attempted.

31
00:01:47,130 --> 00:01:53,660
But if we change our structure and we use an else, if only one of them will ever run.

32
00:01:53,670 --> 00:02:00,810
So if we add else, if it follows the exact same format where we have our parentheses and a condition,

33
00:02:00,930 --> 00:02:03,270
we just add else instead of purely.

34
00:02:03,270 --> 00:02:04,510
If so else.

35
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:12,810
If rating equals two, we'll console.log meets expectations.

36
00:02:15,090 --> 00:02:20,400
Well save refresh the page and when rating is two this prints out.

37
00:02:21,030 --> 00:02:22,200
The first one is attempted.

38
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:22,980
It's false.

39
00:02:22,980 --> 00:02:24,570
So we try this one.

40
00:02:24,750 --> 00:02:25,650
If that one didn't work.

41
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:26,400
Try this.

42
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:30,780
If this one didn't work, we can add in multiple else ifs.

43
00:02:31,140 --> 00:02:32,130
I have a side on it.

44
00:02:32,310 --> 00:02:34,010
We can have as many as we want.

45
00:02:34,020 --> 00:02:36,060
You probably don't want to have a ton of them.

46
00:02:36,060 --> 00:02:42,350
Your code can get pretty long and there might be a better way to refactor or rewrite your massive conditional.

47
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:46,200
But it is valid JavaScript so we could add in the same thing.

48
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:51,720
I'm just going to duplicate this, I'll select it and then shift option down arrow and I'll say if rating

49
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:56,970
is equal to one or else if rating is equal to one needs improvement.

50
00:02:58,300 --> 00:02:59,140
Refresh.

51
00:02:59,170 --> 00:03:00,550
We get the same result.

52
00:03:00,550 --> 00:03:02,980
If rating is one we get.

53
00:03:03,010 --> 00:03:04,020
Needs improvement.

54
00:03:04,030 --> 00:03:05,170
It attempts this.

55
00:03:05,170 --> 00:03:06,120
It's false.

56
00:03:06,130 --> 00:03:07,040
It moves on.

57
00:03:07,060 --> 00:03:08,080
Maybe this one.

58
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:08,920
That's false.

59
00:03:08,950 --> 00:03:09,790
It moves on.

60
00:03:09,820 --> 00:03:10,770
How about this one?

61
00:03:10,780 --> 00:03:13,060
In our case, it's true when rating is one.

62
00:03:13,060 --> 00:03:14,710
So we get this printed out.

63
00:03:14,710 --> 00:03:21,970
So else if is another option to try after the first one does not work and elseif is only valid if there

64
00:03:21,970 --> 00:03:23,560
is an if before it.

65
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:27,190
Otherwise it doesn't make sense in JavaScript will freak out at you.

66
00:03:27,220 --> 00:03:29,620
You can see it's highlighting it for me in V code.

67
00:03:29,740 --> 00:03:34,390
It's expecting some sort of conditional to come before it, meaning it wants.

68
00:03:34,390 --> 00:03:36,790
If so, they have to be paired.

69
00:03:36,790 --> 00:03:40,540
We have our if and then optionally a bunch of else ifs.

70
00:03:41,110 --> 00:03:42,640
So that's pretty much it for elseif.

71
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:44,020
It's relatively straightforward.

72
00:03:44,020 --> 00:03:49,540
If you understand, if it's a same idea, it's just a second option or a third or fourth or however

73
00:03:49,540 --> 00:03:52,660
many you need after the first one, if it was false.

74
00:03:52,660 --> 00:03:54,190
We have one more piece of the puzzle.

75
00:03:54,190 --> 00:03:56,530
We'll talk about it in the next video else.
