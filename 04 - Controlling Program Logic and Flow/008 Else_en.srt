1
00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:00,600
All right.

2
00:00:00,600 --> 00:00:05,840
So right now, the code works for these three ratings, specifically three, two and one.

3
00:00:05,850 --> 00:00:08,510
But what if the rating is something else entirely?

4
00:00:08,520 --> 00:00:11,780
Like zero would be an easy one or 23.

5
00:00:11,790 --> 00:00:16,280
But what if it's also a or good something like that?

6
00:00:16,290 --> 00:00:17,550
We're not accounting for it.

7
00:00:17,550 --> 00:00:19,530
We won't print anything out at all.

8
00:00:19,530 --> 00:00:24,270
It's just ignored and our code doesn't really display anything or doesn't display anything, period,

9
00:00:24,270 --> 00:00:25,080
to the user.

10
00:00:25,110 --> 00:00:28,380
To fix this, we can add in a third piece to our conditional.

11
00:00:28,380 --> 00:00:35,820
We have if else if and we have else else is kind of like the otherwise part of the conditional.

12
00:00:35,850 --> 00:00:37,170
It's the thing that runs.

13
00:00:37,170 --> 00:00:42,240
If nothing else was true before it, then the code inside of else will be executed.

14
00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:47,680
So you can see down here we don't specify a condition and set of parentheses like we do for if and else

15
00:00:47,700 --> 00:00:50,700
if, because it just runs no matter what.

16
00:00:50,700 --> 00:00:57,180
If nothing else ran first so we can add in and else down here just looks like this.

17
00:00:57,990 --> 00:01:03,120
And in our situation, if rating is not three, two or one else will run.

18
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:06,120
If rating is three, two or one else will not run.

19
00:01:06,120 --> 00:01:09,210
Just like if rating is three, nothing else runs.

20
00:01:09,210 --> 00:01:12,030
If rating is two, nothing else runs after it and so on.

21
00:01:12,030 --> 00:01:13,620
Else is the fallback.

22
00:01:13,620 --> 00:01:15,780
It is the final piece of your conditional.

23
00:01:15,810 --> 00:01:21,660
You don't have to have an else, but if you want to have one, you must have an if it doesn't make sense

24
00:01:21,660 --> 00:01:24,210
to have an otherwise if there is no initial.

25
00:01:24,210 --> 00:01:28,350
If so, we'll just cancel that log invalid rating.

26
00:01:30,060 --> 00:01:35,460
We'll save, refresh the page and we end up with invalid rating.

27
00:01:35,790 --> 00:01:41,520
If we have anything other than three to or one, we get invalid if we go back to two.

28
00:01:42,030 --> 00:01:43,230
Oh, that's a string.

29
00:01:43,230 --> 00:01:48,780
So that won't work because we're comparing with triple equals for exactly the number two.

30
00:01:48,930 --> 00:01:52,350
But if we go back to the number two, it works just fine.

31
00:01:52,350 --> 00:01:57,150
So often we do have an if and elseif or multiple else, ifs and else.

32
00:01:57,390 --> 00:02:02,430
And by the way, I forgot to mention we can only have one else per if it doesn't make sense to have

33
00:02:02,430 --> 00:02:03,120
more than one.

34
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:08,669
Otherwise we can have as many ifs as we want and we have one if at the beginning.

35
00:02:09,330 --> 00:02:14,970
So sometimes we have all of them together, but often we'll just have a yes or no, a simple if and

36
00:02:14,970 --> 00:02:15,600
an else.

37
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:16,890
So here's an example.

38
00:02:16,890 --> 00:02:20,220
I have a high score variable and a user score.

39
00:02:20,220 --> 00:02:25,680
So the idea is that we have a game or something where we have a high score, like an old arcade cabinet

40
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:30,420
where it stores the highest score ever on that cabinet and then the current user score.

41
00:02:30,540 --> 00:02:37,230
And we could write a conditional that just checks if the user score is greater then we could even do

42
00:02:37,230 --> 00:02:38,040
equal to.

43
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:41,700
I'm not sure what happens if you equal the high score on a game.

44
00:02:41,700 --> 00:02:43,530
Do you then become the high score?

45
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:45,090
Let's let's say that's how it works.

46
00:02:45,090 --> 00:02:51,090
So if user score is greater than or equal to the current high score, we will cancel that log.

47
00:02:51,090 --> 00:02:53,820
Let's do a template literal.

48
00:02:54,300 --> 00:03:03,840
Congrats you have the new high score of and then let's add it in and we'll show user score.

49
00:03:04,290 --> 00:03:08,490
Then we could also update high score to now equal user score.

50
00:03:09,150 --> 00:03:14,910
If what the user scored is higher than the current high score, then high scores should become that

51
00:03:14,910 --> 00:03:15,510
score.

52
00:03:16,590 --> 00:03:20,040
And then we can add in an else and we'll console.log.

53
00:03:20,790 --> 00:03:29,370
Another template literal good game your score of and then user score with our dollar sign to interpolate.

54
00:03:29,370 --> 00:03:37,380
It did not beat the high score of and then high score.

55
00:03:38,580 --> 00:03:39,270
All right.

56
00:03:39,330 --> 00:03:43,170
So if we run this right now, refresh, we get good game.

57
00:03:43,170 --> 00:03:46,470
Your score of 1200 did not beat the high score of 1430.

58
00:03:46,470 --> 00:03:49,110
If we change this to now be 1600.

59
00:03:50,740 --> 00:03:51,340
Congrats.

60
00:03:51,340 --> 00:03:53,510
You have the new high score of 1600.

61
00:03:53,530 --> 00:03:55,930
So here we have a simple yes or no.

62
00:03:55,960 --> 00:03:59,290
It's either this, and if it's not, then it's this.

63
00:03:59,830 --> 00:04:02,140
There is no scenario where we won't have.

64
00:04:02,140 --> 00:04:04,650
Well, I guess you could write code that breaks.

65
00:04:04,660 --> 00:04:06,780
You could write something that causes an error.

66
00:04:06,790 --> 00:04:11,050
But assuming that doesn't happen, one of these is going to run.

67
00:04:11,050 --> 00:04:12,520
We don't have a bunch of else ifs.

68
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:14,740
We just have a simple if and an else.
