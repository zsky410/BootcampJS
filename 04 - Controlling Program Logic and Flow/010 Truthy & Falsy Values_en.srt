1
00:00:00,090 --> 00:00:05,550
Now that we've seen conditionals, we can talk about this kind of odd topic truthiness and falseness

2
00:00:05,550 --> 00:00:07,470
or truth and false values.

3
00:00:07,650 --> 00:00:14,400
All that this is is that every value in JavaScript has an inherent truthiness or falseness about it.

4
00:00:14,520 --> 00:00:18,380
It doesn't mean it is truth or true or it is false.

5
00:00:18,390 --> 00:00:22,590
There's only two values, true and false, that are actually true and false.

6
00:00:22,620 --> 00:00:27,960
Those are the booleans, but every value has a truth or falseness to it.

7
00:00:27,990 --> 00:00:29,220
Now, let me show you what I mean.

8
00:00:29,310 --> 00:00:35,040
If we were to write a conditional like if let's make a variable called mystery.

9
00:00:35,950 --> 00:00:44,350
Let's do, let's mystery equals five, and then we'll add a conditional of if mystery, just mystery,

10
00:00:44,350 --> 00:00:46,210
not mystery equals anything.

11
00:00:46,210 --> 00:00:50,630
Just if mystery will conceal that log truth.

12
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:57,270
And then else we can contact Logue Falsey.

13
00:01:00,330 --> 00:01:04,349
I'm not sure if falsity is spelled like that or that it's not really the technical term.

14
00:01:05,220 --> 00:01:12,300
But anyway, we are just checking this single condition if mystery, which is right now set to five.

15
00:01:12,420 --> 00:01:14,900
If that is true, thi this would print.

16
00:01:14,910 --> 00:01:17,850
If it's not true thi meaning it's falsely this would print.

17
00:01:17,970 --> 00:01:19,110
Let's see what we get.

18
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:20,670
We get true thi.

19
00:01:20,820 --> 00:01:23,610
So the number five is a truth e value.

20
00:01:23,610 --> 00:01:28,650
In fact, every number that you could possibly choose except for zero is true.

21
00:01:29,820 --> 00:01:31,460
You can see zero is false.

22
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:37,860
The only caveat to that is not a number which we've seen a couple of times that is also falsely.

23
00:01:37,980 --> 00:01:41,640
So something like zero divided by zero is going to give us not a number.

24
00:01:41,730 --> 00:01:44,190
I'm refreshing and we still see false.

25
00:01:44,250 --> 00:01:46,960
Almost every single value in java script is true.

26
00:01:46,990 --> 00:01:49,590
Thi except for these right here.

27
00:01:49,770 --> 00:01:53,730
So the actual value of false of course is false.

28
00:01:54,090 --> 00:01:57,540
Zero, as we just saw, is false empty string.

29
00:01:57,540 --> 00:01:58,830
So there's no space in there.

30
00:01:58,830 --> 00:02:06,930
It's just an empty string like this that is falsely null, undefined and not a number.

31
00:02:07,110 --> 00:02:10,490
Everything else, excluding these, everything else, is truth.

32
00:02:11,190 --> 00:02:12,330
Now, why does this matter?

33
00:02:12,330 --> 00:02:13,670
Why should you really care?

34
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:16,140
It's not just a little piece of trivia to know.

35
00:02:16,290 --> 00:02:23,220
Often you'll see people use this strategy if some variable do something, not mystery, but something

36
00:02:23,220 --> 00:02:23,850
like this.

37
00:02:23,850 --> 00:02:36,570
If, let's say current user or logged in user then console.log, something like you are logged in else

38
00:02:38,130 --> 00:02:39,450
console.log.

39
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:42,240
Please log in.

40
00:02:42,510 --> 00:02:43,070
Okay.

41
00:02:43,260 --> 00:02:45,870
So something like this is pretty common.

42
00:02:45,870 --> 00:02:51,720
Maybe not console logging, but displaying a certain page showing the sign in button versus the sign

43
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:52,560
out button.

44
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:55,920
We're just checking if a variable is toothy.

45
00:02:56,280 --> 00:03:02,040
So if we define logged in user and it's set to I don't know.

46
00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:07,230
Thomas One, two, three, we're going to see you are logged in.

47
00:03:07,350 --> 00:03:15,360
But if it is not set to anything like undefined, please logged in, please log in or if it's set to

48
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:17,130
null, which would be another option.

49
00:03:17,490 --> 00:03:18,690
Please log in.

50
00:03:18,930 --> 00:03:25,950
Same thing if we had a string for somebody name username we could write if username and if that username

51
00:03:25,950 --> 00:03:29,340
is still an empty string, then that code would not run.

52
00:03:29,340 --> 00:03:32,580
If it was anything else in that string, it would run.

53
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:38,790
So this is just a small side topic, but you will see this pretty frequently checking for a value.

54
00:03:38,820 --> 00:03:42,270
We're not checking to see if it's equal to something in particular.

55
00:03:42,270 --> 00:03:48,240
We're seeing if it's true, which usually is a way of checking if something has content, if it exists,

56
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:55,350
if it's not null, undefined, zero, false, empty string or not a number, anything else will pass

57
00:03:55,350 --> 00:03:56,340
this condition.
