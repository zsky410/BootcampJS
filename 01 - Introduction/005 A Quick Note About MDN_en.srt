00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:05,430
One more thing before we really get rolling here, I want to talk about a website called MDM Mozilla

2
00:00:05,430 --> 00:00:06,510
Developer Network.

3
00:00:06,540 --> 00:00:12,930
MDM is just about the closest thing to an official documentation for JavaScript that we have.

4
00:00:13,290 --> 00:00:19,020
If you watch the video where I talked about schema and script and different versions and new features

5
00:00:19,020 --> 00:00:25,440
and how there's not really a official JavaScript that we can just go download that it's really an implementation

6
00:00:25,440 --> 00:00:28,960
of this script spec across different browsers.

7
00:00:28,980 --> 00:00:32,520
That's the same reason we don't have one official documentation.

8
00:00:32,549 --> 00:00:39,750
It's not like a language like Python where you can go to Python or Python dot org and see the docs for

9
00:00:39,750 --> 00:00:41,530
Python two or Python three.

10
00:00:41,550 --> 00:00:47,970
With JavaScript, things are a little murkier, but MSDN is a really good resource.

11
00:00:47,970 --> 00:00:49,340
So this is what it looks like.

12
00:00:49,350 --> 00:00:50,580
Developer Mozilla.

13
00:00:50,790 --> 00:00:51,420
Org.

14
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:57,330
What I do, if I'm ever googling something and I'm trying to understand how a feature works in JavaScript

15
00:00:57,330 --> 00:01:03,930
or I can't remember the name of a particular method, I'll Google and add in at the end of my Google

16
00:01:03,930 --> 00:01:05,940
search so I get these search results.

17
00:01:05,940 --> 00:01:10,350
So just as a quick example here, we go to references and guides.

18
00:01:10,350 --> 00:01:16,410
There are some tutorials here, but if you go to technologies and you look at JavaScript, this gives

19
00:01:16,410 --> 00:01:20,030
you a whole reference of pretty much everything in JavaScript.

20
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:26,490
If we talk about arrays, which we will shortly in the course, if you go to the array page here, there's

21
00:01:26,490 --> 00:01:31,200
all sorts of information and tons of links about all the different things that arrays can do.

22
00:01:31,230 --> 00:01:35,670
So you'll see me reference MDM quite a bit in this course and I just thought I should take a moment

23
00:01:35,670 --> 00:01:43,260
to address it, introduce the idea of MD and remember, it's not an official documentation for JavaScript.

24
00:01:43,260 --> 00:01:48,720
It's put out by Mozilla, the company that makes Firefox, and it's just a great resource for learning

25
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:55,470
JavaScript, but it's also an invaluable reference for existing developers and maybe teachers who are

26
00:01:55,470 --> 00:01:59,280
teaching Udemy courses who need to refresh their memories on certain things.

27
00:01:59,490 --> 00:02:01,140
So you'll see it a lot in the course.
