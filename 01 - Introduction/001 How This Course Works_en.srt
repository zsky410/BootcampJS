00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:01,970
Hey, everyone, welcome to the course.

2
00:00:01,980 --> 00:00:02,969
My name is Colt.

3
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:04,610
Thank you for joining us.

4
00:00:04,620 --> 00:00:06,560
So I'm really excited about this course.

5
00:00:06,570 --> 00:00:11,400
Honestly, more excited than I've been about pretty much any Udemy course I've put out so far.

6
00:00:11,670 --> 00:00:13,980
I'm excited for a couple of reasons I'll go into.

7
00:00:14,010 --> 00:00:16,050
First of all, I just like JavaScript.

8
00:00:16,050 --> 00:00:17,610
It's a very fun topic to teach.

9
00:00:17,610 --> 00:00:21,660
We can do a lot of really cool things with it and this course covers everything.

10
00:00:21,660 --> 00:00:22,290
JavaScript.

11
00:00:22,290 --> 00:00:28,650
It's a ton of JavaScript that we talk about from the very basics up to some pretty complex projects.

12
00:00:28,650 --> 00:00:33,000
So what I want to start with here is a rough overview of how the course works.

13
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,880
The course is pretty unique in how it structured.

14
00:00:35,880 --> 00:00:37,890
There are two distinct parts.

15
00:00:37,890 --> 00:00:43,710
The first part is a start to finish introduction to JavaScript for beginners, starting from the very,

16
00:00:43,710 --> 00:00:50,220
very basics of getting set up variables up to more complex topics like Dom, manipulation and events,

17
00:00:50,220 --> 00:00:54,810
all the latest features and JavaScript things like Arrow functions, promises.

18
00:00:54,810 --> 00:00:59,130
And then part two of the course is focused exclusively on projects.

19
00:00:59,130 --> 00:01:05,610
So those projects include lots of new topics, things like Node or Express or creating your own database,

20
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:07,680
lots of really fun things coming up.

21
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:09,330
But there is a distinction.

22
00:01:09,540 --> 00:01:11,700
Here's another visual, the same idea.

23
00:01:11,700 --> 00:01:17,640
We've got the building blocks first, starting from the very basics, and then part two is all projects.

24
00:01:18,730 --> 00:01:21,270
So to take this course, you have a couple of different options.

25
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:26,710
If you are a complete beginner, you don't really know JavaScript, then start at the beginning.

26
00:01:26,830 --> 00:01:31,900
Start with the basics, make your way through the first 20 ish sections and then move on to all the

27
00:01:31,900 --> 00:01:32,680
projects.

28
00:01:32,770 --> 00:01:37,480
If you're someone who has some JavaScript experience, maybe you've taken one of my courses already

29
00:01:37,480 --> 00:01:38,710
or a similar course.

30
00:01:38,710 --> 00:01:40,930
You may not need to start at the very beginning.

31
00:01:40,930 --> 00:01:45,490
So what you could do is jump right into the projects and just start building something.

32
00:01:45,490 --> 00:01:50,650
There's almost 20 hours of projects in this course and if you do happen to hit a wall, you run into

33
00:01:50,650 --> 00:01:51,280
trouble.

34
00:01:51,310 --> 00:01:55,840
You can go back to the first part of the course and just review the parts that you need to.

35
00:01:55,870 --> 00:02:01,360
If you need to review aero functions or async functions or the spread operator or some newer features

36
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:06,430
in JavaScript that that maybe weren't covered in the last course you saw on JavaScript, that's a great

37
00:02:06,430 --> 00:02:07,060
option for you.

38
00:02:07,060 --> 00:02:11,140
Start with the projects and then reference the first part of the course whenever necessary.

39
00:02:11,140 --> 00:02:12,790
So that's how the course is structured.

40
00:02:12,790 --> 00:02:14,290
We've got two main parts.

41
00:02:14,290 --> 00:02:19,690
I think there's something here for I won't say everyone, there's probably not anything here for someone

42
00:02:19,690 --> 00:02:24,040
who doesn't care about JavaScript, but for anyone who is interested in JavaScript, whether you have

43
00:02:24,040 --> 00:02:29,080
no experience, whether you've taken one of my courses or Stephen's courses and you're just looking

44
00:02:29,080 --> 00:02:31,600
to build projects, there's something here for you.
