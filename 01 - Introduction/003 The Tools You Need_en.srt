1
00:00:00,090 --> 00:00:00,480
All right.

2
00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:03,580
So next up, let's discuss the tools you need for the course.

3
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:08,430
It's pretty simple, at least for the first part of the course until we get to Node, but we'll cross

4
00:00:08,430 --> 00:00:09,930
that bridge when we get there.

5
00:00:10,110 --> 00:00:14,970
The two main tools that I highly recommend you install are Chrome as a web browser.

6
00:00:14,970 --> 00:00:21,150
You definitely can use any web browser of your choice if you are particularly tied to Firefox, for

7
00:00:21,150 --> 00:00:21,900
example.

8
00:00:21,930 --> 00:00:25,530
There's nothing wrong with using that, but I'll be using Chrome as well.

9
00:00:25,530 --> 00:00:30,510
Steven Which makes it a lot easier for you to follow along, especially as we talk about the specifics

10
00:00:30,510 --> 00:00:31,980
of the developer tools.

11
00:00:32,340 --> 00:00:38,400
I would say in general, I would not recommend using Internet Explorer Safari.

12
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:40,380
It definitely will work.

13
00:00:40,380 --> 00:00:44,310
But if you have Chrome or Firefox, use one of those, preferably Chrome.

14
00:00:44,730 --> 00:00:49,260
It's as simple as going to google.com slash chrome and clicking download.

15
00:00:49,620 --> 00:00:52,620
It will just make for a better experience if we're on the same page.

16
00:00:52,620 --> 00:00:59,070
And as far as the editor that I'm using, I highly recommend VS code, not just because I'm going to

17
00:00:59,070 --> 00:01:02,460
be using it in the course and it will be easier for you to follow along.

18
00:01:02,460 --> 00:01:06,450
But also it is just my personal editor of Choice these days.

19
00:01:06,450 --> 00:01:07,290
It's free.

20
00:01:07,290 --> 00:01:13,590
It's a great editor, great community around it, lots of amazing extensions and color themes and lots

21
00:01:13,590 --> 00:01:14,850
of fun things you can do.

22
00:01:14,850 --> 00:01:18,500
And if you don't have it downloaded already, I would recommend you do that.

23
00:01:18,510 --> 00:01:23,580
Now, if you are somebody who already has a different editor that you are super tied to that, you know,

24
00:01:23,580 --> 00:01:27,180
like the back of your hand, which that expression never made sense to me.

25
00:01:27,180 --> 00:01:31,920
But if you happen to know it like the back of your hand, then use that editor.

26
00:01:32,550 --> 00:01:38,670
I'm not going to be doing anything all that specific to vs code, but if you're new and you're looking

27
00:01:38,670 --> 00:01:41,010
for an editor, this is the one I would go with.

28
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:43,920
VS Code stands for Visual Studio Code.

29
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:46,710
It's free, it's developed by Microsoft.

30
00:01:46,950 --> 00:01:48,630
I can't say enough good things about it.

31
00:01:49,260 --> 00:01:50,190
I really can't.

32
00:01:50,190 --> 00:01:51,540
So download it.

33
00:01:51,540 --> 00:01:56,730
And just to show you what my version looks like, I have changed a couple of settings.

34
00:01:57,060 --> 00:02:03,300
I've changed the color theme, I've changed the UI theme and some of the icons you can see over here.

35
00:02:03,300 --> 00:02:05,340
But otherwise I haven't done a whole lot.

36
00:02:05,340 --> 00:02:11,850
And if you do want to make your editor look exactly like mine, I won't waste time in the course itself.

37
00:02:11,850 --> 00:02:13,050
Talking about setup.

38
00:02:13,050 --> 00:02:18,510
It's not very JavaScript specific and I'd like to get right to JavaScript, but if you want to learn

39
00:02:18,510 --> 00:02:24,960
more, I'll include a link right after this video as a text lecture where you can watch my YouTube video,

40
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:28,440
where I talk about setting up my editor and all the extensions I use.

41
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:34,470
So vs Code and Chrome, the two tools I really recommend you install for the first part of this course.

42
00:02:34,470 --> 00:02:38,910
And then later on we'll talk about node and installation for some of the other tools.
