1
00:00:00,720 --> 00:00:04,830
Now that we have our goal, let's make sure that we show able as well that the user can manipulate by

2
00:00:04,830 --> 00:00:06,240
pressing their keyboard keys.

3
00:00:06,660 --> 00:00:09,160
I'm going to find where we just added in the goal of moment to go.

4
00:00:09,180 --> 00:00:13,710
I'm going to add a comment right above it that says goal, just to remind myself that that is what that

5
00:00:13,710 --> 00:00:14,550
code is for.

6
00:00:14,670 --> 00:00:18,840
The variable name kind of explains that, but it's still good practice to have a comment anyways.

7
00:00:19,470 --> 00:00:22,830
So then underneath that section I'll add in ball.

8
00:00:23,650 --> 00:00:25,870
So this is where we're going to draw our ball out.

9
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:28,450
I'm going to first create a variable called Wall.

10
00:00:29,680 --> 00:00:34,630
I'll do a bodysuit circle, because in this case, we want to create a circle, not a rectangle.

11
00:00:35,260 --> 00:00:38,110
And inside of here, we could definitely have a fixed ball size.

12
00:00:38,110 --> 00:00:42,820
But once again, if we have a fixed ball size, it might make a lot of sense on how large the ball is

13
00:00:42,820 --> 00:00:44,380
when we have only three cells.

14
00:00:44,380 --> 00:00:48,850
But as we start to have a tighter and tighter maze, if the ball is too large, it's not going to actually

15
00:00:48,850 --> 00:00:50,620
be able to make it through the maze at all.

16
00:00:50,860 --> 00:00:55,030
So we probably just need to make sure that we kind of scale the size of the ball along with the unit

17
00:00:55,030 --> 00:00:55,540
length.

18
00:00:57,150 --> 00:01:02,280
The other thing we need to be aware of is that the first two arguments to circle is the x y coordinate

19
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:04,170
of the very center of the circle.

20
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:09,300
So we probably need to make sure that we also adjust that starting location to always be at the very

21
00:01:09,300 --> 00:01:11,610
center of that first cell right there.

22
00:01:12,780 --> 00:01:13,980
So let's get to it.

23
00:01:14,910 --> 00:01:20,190
For these starting x y coordinate, we're going to show the ball at unit length.

24
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:22,490
Divided by two.

25
00:01:23,170 --> 00:01:27,850
That essentially means take the width of this first cell, divide it by two and put it right there in

26
00:01:27,850 --> 00:01:28,750
the very center.

27
00:01:29,020 --> 00:01:33,370
And we're going to do that both for the X coordinate and Y coordinate as well.

28
00:01:34,530 --> 00:01:37,650
And for the diameter of the ball will do a unit length.

29
00:01:37,830 --> 00:01:43,270
So that's the width of one cell and we'll make the ball half the size of a cell so we can do a times

30
00:01:43,270 --> 00:01:46,530
0.5 or divided by two as well.

31
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:51,030
And I can go ahead and add that ball into the world.

32
00:01:51,030 --> 00:01:51,360
So.

33
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:51,660
World.

34
00:01:51,930 --> 00:01:52,500
Add.

35
00:01:53,240 --> 00:01:54,650
World and ball.

36
00:01:56,840 --> 00:01:57,110
It's.

37
00:01:57,110 --> 00:01:58,070
I'll save this.

38
00:01:58,400 --> 00:02:00,350
I'll flip back over, refresh.

39
00:02:00,650 --> 00:02:01,700
And there we go.

40
00:02:02,180 --> 00:02:04,260
Now the ball is looking just a little bit too large.

41
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:06,200
Well, I think I just made a mistake here.

42
00:02:06,230 --> 00:02:07,680
The third argument.

43
00:02:07,700 --> 00:02:11,780
I did this on my own when I was actually writing this application as well.

44
00:02:11,810 --> 00:02:15,670
The third argument I just assumed was the actual overall diameter.

45
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:17,710
It's actually the radius of the ball.

46
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:22,520
So right now, a unit length divided by two means that the ball is going to be essentially exactly equal

47
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:23,780
to the width of a cell.

48
00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:24,680
My mistake.

49
00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:29,090
So the last argument here to be the radius correctly should actually be unit length divided by four.

50
00:02:30,290 --> 00:02:31,380
They'll try that again.

51
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:33,170
Refresh and that's better.

52
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:35,660
So now the ball is half the width of a cell.

53
00:02:37,720 --> 00:02:37,970
Yes.

54
00:02:37,990 --> 00:02:43,300
Now, the last thing we really have to do is make sure that a ball can collide with the goal.

55
00:02:43,300 --> 00:02:48,850
And we need to make sure that we press on our keyboard keys of ways and we apply some velocity or movement

56
00:02:48,850 --> 00:02:49,960
to the ball as well.

57
00:02:50,350 --> 00:02:52,470
So first, make sure that we can move the ball around.

58
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:54,220
Let's take care of that in the next video.
