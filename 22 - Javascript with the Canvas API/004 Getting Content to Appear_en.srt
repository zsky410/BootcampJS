1
00:00:00,900 --> 00:00:04,500
Now that we have a better idea of some of these different pieces of terminology, let's start to write

2
00:00:04,500 --> 00:00:09,690
some code rather than directly focusing on creating a maze like this right here, which will end up

3
00:00:09,690 --> 00:00:10,970
being rather complicated.

4
00:00:10,980 --> 00:00:16,309
We're going to instead do a little demo first just to kind of get a handle on exactly what matter JHS

5
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:16,900
is.

6
00:00:16,950 --> 00:00:22,020
So we are going to implement this demo that you see right here where we essentially have a bunch of

7
00:00:22,020 --> 00:00:27,750
shapes all in a pile, and we can drag one around and move them all when they all get kind of collisions

8
00:00:27,750 --> 00:00:28,770
between each of them.

9
00:00:29,010 --> 00:00:33,780
So first we'll build this, then rebuild over to the maze type implementation.

10
00:00:34,170 --> 00:00:35,370
So let's get to it.

11
00:00:35,400 --> 00:00:40,710
I'm going to first go back over to my code editor and inside my index file are going to first get started

12
00:00:40,710 --> 00:00:46,350
by requiring in or getting access to a couple of different objects out of the matter library.

13
00:00:46,740 --> 00:00:48,120
So I'm going to say const.

14
00:00:48,210 --> 00:00:56,940
I'm then going to do some DE structuring and I'm going to get access to engine render, runner, world

15
00:00:57,060 --> 00:00:58,560
and bodies.

16
00:00:58,830 --> 00:01:02,130
And that's all going to come from matter like so.

17
00:01:03,040 --> 00:01:09,190
So when we included the matter script tag back inside of indexed HTML that added in a new global variable

18
00:01:09,190 --> 00:01:11,410
of matter and that is essentially the matter.

19
00:01:11,410 --> 00:01:12,430
JS Library.

20
00:01:12,430 --> 00:01:17,890
So everything we're going to work with is contained inside that object in order to create an engine,

21
00:01:17,890 --> 00:01:21,700
render, blah, blah, all this stuff, we're going to pull out some of these different objects and

22
00:01:21,700 --> 00:01:23,470
then work with them inside this file.

23
00:01:24,160 --> 00:01:27,850
Now you'll notice that a lot of these terms right here are the same ones that we just discussed in the

24
00:01:27,850 --> 00:01:28,690
last video.

25
00:01:29,170 --> 00:01:34,750
So we were going to use the engine to essentially transition from a current state of our entire world

26
00:01:34,750 --> 00:01:37,450
or all the shapes we have into some new state.

27
00:01:38,080 --> 00:01:41,440
The render is going to be used to draw this stuff onto the screen.

28
00:01:41,710 --> 00:01:45,580
The runner is going to coordinate updates between the engine and the world.

29
00:01:45,610 --> 00:01:51,610
And then I had said on that diagram, Body Bodies is kind of a reference to the entire collection of

30
00:01:51,610 --> 00:01:55,000
all the different shapes we can create, essentially the same thing we saw on the diagram.

31
00:01:55,000 --> 00:02:01,210
So a bodies object represents our ability to create circles, rectangles, squares and so on.

32
00:02:02,660 --> 00:02:05,270
Then instead of here, we're going to write out some boilerplate code.

33
00:02:05,300 --> 00:02:10,430
Now, once again, it's not strictly necessary for you to 100% understand all the lines we're about

34
00:02:10,430 --> 00:02:11,090
to write.

35
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:15,970
I just want you to have some terminology so you understand some of the boilerplate.

36
00:02:15,980 --> 00:02:20,390
But at the end of the day, a lot of the stuff just just gets duplicated between all the different matter

37
00:02:20,390 --> 00:02:21,800
apps you might end up creating.

38
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:28,300
The first thing we're going to do is create a new engine by saying engine create.

39
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:34,270
We're then going to get access to a world that got created along with that engine.

40
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:38,440
So let's say cost world is coming from engine.

41
00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:42,490
So technically when we create an engine, we get a world object along with it.

42
00:02:42,490 --> 00:02:46,480
And again, a world is kind of like a snapshot of all the different shapes that we have.

43
00:02:47,650 --> 00:02:50,260
After that, we'll then create our render object.

44
00:02:50,260 --> 00:02:53,680
So this is what is going to actually show some content on the screen.

45
00:02:54,220 --> 00:03:01,720
Let's say const render is render create and we're going to pass it in options object.

46
00:03:02,230 --> 00:03:07,060
Inside of here, we're going to tell the render where we want to show our representation of everything

47
00:03:07,060 --> 00:03:09,040
inside of our HTML document.

48
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:12,670
So I'm going to say element is document dot body.

49
00:03:13,300 --> 00:03:18,400
So in other words, go and render the representation of the world inside of documents body.

50
00:03:18,880 --> 00:03:20,920
And this is a additive process.

51
00:03:20,920 --> 00:03:25,310
In other words, it's not going to destroy all the content that we already have inside of our body element.

52
00:03:25,330 --> 00:03:29,140
It's going to instead add in a new additional element to the body element.

53
00:03:30,860 --> 00:03:33,770
After that, we're going to specify what engine to use.

54
00:03:35,430 --> 00:03:38,850
And they'll pass in also an options object.

55
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:40,830
Inside the options object.

56
00:03:40,830 --> 00:03:46,320
I'm going to specify the height and width of our canvas element that's going to be used to display all

57
00:03:46,320 --> 00:03:47,250
this content.

58
00:03:47,250 --> 00:03:49,500
So I'm going to put in a width of 800.

59
00:03:50,570 --> 00:03:52,430
And a height of 600.

60
00:03:52,820 --> 00:03:54,410
So these are pixel values right here.

61
00:03:54,410 --> 00:03:58,760
So we're saying give me something that is 800 units wide and 600 elements tall.

62
00:04:00,220 --> 00:04:05,470
Then after that, we're going to tell our render element or our render object to start working and start

63
00:04:05,470 --> 00:04:08,710
to draw all the updates of our world onto the screen.

64
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:11,050
So I'll say render run.

65
00:04:11,850 --> 00:04:13,680
Now I'll pass in lowercase render.

66
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:16,140
So that's the actual render object that we just created.

67
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:19,570
And then I'll call runner run.

68
00:04:20,500 --> 00:04:23,650
With runners create and engine.

69
00:04:23,650 --> 00:04:30,190
So again, the runner right here is what coordinates all these changes from state to state B of our

70
00:04:30,190 --> 00:04:30,760
engine.

71
00:04:31,770 --> 00:04:36,150
So it's just that we should be able to save this and then go back over and see something appear on the

72
00:04:36,150 --> 00:04:36,750
screen.

73
00:04:37,330 --> 00:04:38,610
It's going to go back over to my browser.

74
00:04:38,610 --> 00:04:42,180
I'll refresh and I see a big black box appear.

75
00:04:42,450 --> 00:04:46,110
So this is where we're going to eventually see all of our shapes up here over time.

76
00:04:46,770 --> 00:04:52,560
So now we can start to think about how we just add a very simple and plain shape to add a simple shape

77
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:54,510
to our world.

78
00:04:56,010 --> 00:04:57,510
Down here, I'm going to say.

79
00:04:57,810 --> 00:04:59,130
Collins shape.

80
00:04:59,830 --> 00:05:02,860
Is Bodies, dot rectangle.

81
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:06,100
And I'm going to pass in a couple of dimensions for this thing.

82
00:05:06,100 --> 00:05:09,250
We'll talk about exactly what these dimensions represent in just a moment.

83
00:05:09,820 --> 00:05:16,720
I'm going to put in here 200, 250, 50, and then an options object.

84
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:21,910
And inside that options object, I'll say is static is true like so.

85
00:05:23,220 --> 00:05:29,580
Then after that, I'll call WorldCom and I'll pass in the world that we got just a little bit ago when

86
00:05:29,580 --> 00:05:31,320
we created our engine right there.

87
00:05:32,270 --> 00:05:35,630
And then as a second argument, I'll pass in the shape that I just created.

88
00:05:36,760 --> 00:05:37,390
Like so.

89
00:05:38,670 --> 00:05:38,950
Okay.

90
00:05:38,970 --> 00:05:40,920
So we'll talk about what that code is doing in just a moment.

91
00:05:40,920 --> 00:05:42,390
But first, let's save this.

92
00:05:42,420 --> 00:05:47,610
Go back over and we can see a shape up here inside of our element.

93
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:50,760
So that's the basics of getting something to show up on the screen.

94
00:05:50,760 --> 00:05:55,050
But obviously, we just wrote out a lot of code that's possibly really mysterious.

95
00:05:55,050 --> 00:05:58,440
So let's talk about what's going on here after a very quick break.
