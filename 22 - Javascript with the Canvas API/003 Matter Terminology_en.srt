1
00:00:00,530 --> 00:00:04,130
Now that we have done a little bit of project set up, I want to give you some high level notes on the

2
00:00:04,130 --> 00:00:04,370
matter.

3
00:00:04,370 --> 00:00:05,450
Just library.

4
00:00:05,630 --> 00:00:06,740
Just so you know, matter.

5
00:00:06,740 --> 00:00:12,630
Case has some really good documentation and you can always read it by going to the main page, the RMI

6
00:00:13,100 --> 00:00:17,180
matter JS and then finding documentation on the left hand side.

7
00:00:18,030 --> 00:00:22,200
On the left here, you're going to see all the different objects inside of this library.

8
00:00:22,230 --> 00:00:24,980
I'm going to tell you about all the different objects you need to be aware of.

9
00:00:24,990 --> 00:00:29,610
But if you get stuck at any point in time throughout this application, you can always come and check

10
00:00:29,610 --> 00:00:34,560
out the documentation to get a better idea of exactly what we're working with inside this library.

11
00:00:35,300 --> 00:00:38,840
I want to give you a couple of highlights of the different things we're going to be working with in

12
00:00:38,840 --> 00:00:39,330
here.

13
00:00:39,350 --> 00:00:43,400
In general, this is just going to be some terminology so that you understand some of the code that

14
00:00:43,400 --> 00:00:45,020
we're going to be writing very soon.

15
00:00:45,880 --> 00:00:46,200
Okay.

16
00:00:46,210 --> 00:00:49,810
So here are some of the important pieces of terminology that you need to be aware of.

17
00:00:50,230 --> 00:00:54,910
The first piece of terminology that is used inside of the matter Library is World.

18
00:00:55,240 --> 00:01:00,610
This is an object that contains all the different things or shapes inside of our application.

19
00:01:01,180 --> 00:01:06,880
So if we go back over to the official docs or the official page and take a look at all the demos and

20
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:11,410
look at the Mixed Shape demo, you're going to see a bunch of different shapes all over the screen.

21
00:01:12,670 --> 00:01:18,340
The entire scene that we see right here is essentially represented inside of that world object.

22
00:01:18,670 --> 00:01:24,220
So this world thing that we're talking about right here, it tracks the location, position, speed,

23
00:01:24,220 --> 00:01:25,780
because see how these things can move.

24
00:01:25,810 --> 00:01:30,430
So the velocity of each item as well, they all get tracked inside that world object.

25
00:01:31,700 --> 00:01:34,490
The next piece of terminology we need to be aware of is engine.

26
00:01:34,760 --> 00:01:40,460
This is a object that has a bunch of different functions in it that's going to read in the current state

27
00:01:40,460 --> 00:01:42,980
of the world from the world object.

28
00:01:43,340 --> 00:01:46,310
So the world object knows where every shape is right now.

29
00:01:46,310 --> 00:01:49,250
It knows every shapes, velocity, weight and so on.

30
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:55,010
The engine is going to read in all that data and it's going to calculate changes in positions for all

31
00:01:55,010 --> 00:01:56,180
those different shapes.

32
00:01:56,540 --> 00:02:01,310
So we can imagine that the world is kind of like a snapshot of everything as it stands in an instant

33
00:02:01,310 --> 00:02:02,090
in time.

34
00:02:02,300 --> 00:02:07,370
The engine is responsible for transitioning from one snapshot to another.

35
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:12,510
The runner is what makes the world an engine work together.

36
00:02:12,750 --> 00:02:18,990
So the runner is going to essentially run about 60 times per second until the engine to process all

37
00:02:18,990 --> 00:02:21,330
the data stored inside the world object.

38
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,610
The next big thing is the render object.

39
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:31,520
So whenever the engine processes an update and says, okay, here's a new snapshot of data, here's

40
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:36,650
a new version of the world, the render object is going to take a look at all those different shapes

41
00:02:36,650 --> 00:02:38,930
and it's going to show them all on the screen.

42
00:02:39,470 --> 00:02:44,420
So the render object is essentially what takes all of our data and shows it in this little element right

43
00:02:44,420 --> 00:02:45,800
here that we're playing around with.

44
00:02:48,030 --> 00:02:51,120
Finally, last piece of terminology is body.

45
00:02:51,450 --> 00:02:53,940
This is going to be a shape that gets displayed.

46
00:02:53,970 --> 00:02:57,990
There are many different types of bodies available to us when we're making use of matter DJ's.

47
00:02:58,140 --> 00:03:04,320
So we can create a body that represents a circle or a rectangle or an oval or a triangle, or just about

48
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:05,430
anything else.

49
00:03:05,430 --> 00:03:10,530
Any kind of arbitrary shaped polygon can be created using the body object.

50
00:03:10,920 --> 00:03:14,640
So the application that we're going to create, the Maze Game, is going to have many of these different

51
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:16,110
bodies inside of it.

52
00:03:17,060 --> 00:03:20,840
Now, one thing I want to mention here is that I'm going over this terminology rather quickly, because

53
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:26,000
at the end of the day, you don't really need to understand the terminology here to write a better job

54
00:03:26,030 --> 00:03:26,670
application.

55
00:03:26,690 --> 00:03:27,950
That's kind of the beauty of it.

56
00:03:28,070 --> 00:03:31,640
The only reason I'm telling you about these different pieces of terminology is that we're going to very

57
00:03:31,640 --> 00:03:36,140
quickly start to write some kind of boilerplate code to set our application up.

58
00:03:36,770 --> 00:03:42,350
And so I just want you to have some idea of what all these different terms mean for the purpose of writing

59
00:03:42,350 --> 00:03:43,660
that boilerplate code.

60
00:03:43,670 --> 00:03:48,620
But honestly, it's essentially write that code once to set up the application, and that's pretty much

61
00:03:48,620 --> 00:03:48,930
it.

62
00:03:48,950 --> 00:03:54,110
After that, the only things that we really need to be aware of is the body object, because the vast

63
00:03:54,110 --> 00:03:57,650
majority of code that we're going to write inside of our application is all about showing different

64
00:03:57,650 --> 00:04:03,260
bodies on the screen, essentially the different walls of our maze and the ball that the user is going

65
00:04:03,260 --> 00:04:04,310
to be manipulating.

66
00:04:04,310 --> 00:04:09,890
And this green square at the bottom, every shape inside of this diagram right here will be represented

67
00:04:09,890 --> 00:04:12,030
inside of our wrap with a body.

68
00:04:12,050 --> 00:04:16,940
So again, we really just need to understand what a body is and all those other pieces of terminology

69
00:04:16,940 --> 00:04:20,269
I'm just throwing out there so that you're vaguely aware that they exist.

70
00:04:21,019 --> 00:04:21,160
Okay.

71
00:04:21,350 --> 00:04:23,500
So now we've got a little bit of terminology put together.

72
00:04:23,510 --> 00:04:26,870
Let's take one more pause and we'll start writing some code in the next video.
