1
00:00:01,250 --> 00:00:06,050
All right, let's make sure that when we press on the W, A, C and D keys on our keyboard, we apply

2
00:00:06,050 --> 00:00:09,200
some movement or velocity to this ball right here.

3
00:00:09,770 --> 00:00:13,460
The first thing we have to do is figure out how we're going to detect whenever a user presses a key

4
00:00:13,490 --> 00:00:14,390
on their keyboard.

5
00:00:14,840 --> 00:00:17,420
Well, to be honest, there's not really a lot of magic to this.

6
00:00:17,420 --> 00:00:20,480
We're going to set up an event listener on our document.

7
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:26,180
And that means whenever a user presses any key on their keyboard anywhere on our application, we'll

8
00:00:26,180 --> 00:00:28,130
be able to detect that key press.

9
00:00:28,460 --> 00:00:35,180
So underneath my ball, I'm going to add in a document that add event listener and we're going to listen

10
00:00:35,180 --> 00:00:37,250
for an event called Key Down.

11
00:00:38,540 --> 00:00:43,160
As you can probably guess, the key down event is going to be triggered any time the user presses down

12
00:00:43,160 --> 00:00:44,300
on a key on their keyboard.

13
00:00:45,160 --> 00:00:48,910
So we'll then receive that event object and I'm going to do a console.log.

14
00:00:49,640 --> 00:00:53,450
Of the event because we're going to see something really interesting in there really quickly.

15
00:00:54,650 --> 00:00:55,710
So I'm going to save this.

16
00:00:55,730 --> 00:01:01,280
Flip back over to refresh and then I'm going to click anywhere on the screen and slide my actual application

17
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:02,840
and then just press a key.

18
00:01:04,050 --> 00:01:05,450
I'll first start off by pressing the key.

19
00:01:05,459 --> 00:01:12,210
W If I then expand this event object, we're going to see a couple of different interesting properties.

20
00:01:12,570 --> 00:01:16,410
So the one that is probably most relevant right there says Key.

21
00:01:16,620 --> 00:01:19,140
So that tells us the key that was just pressed by the user.

22
00:01:19,320 --> 00:01:22,080
There's also a key code property as well.

23
00:01:22,410 --> 00:01:28,260
Traditionally we use the key code property to decide exactly what character the user just typed on as

24
00:01:28,260 --> 00:01:29,820
opposed to the key property.

25
00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:34,680
Each different key on your keyboard has a different code so we can look up all these different codes

26
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:39,810
to decide exactly what key was just pressed and then impart some appropriate velocity on the ball in

27
00:01:39,810 --> 00:01:41,010
the appropriate direction.

28
00:01:41,910 --> 00:01:44,670
So I can also do an A oops.

29
00:01:44,670 --> 00:01:46,620
I need to select the actual app first.

30
00:01:46,980 --> 00:01:50,130
There's my A that gives me a key code of 65.

31
00:01:51,840 --> 00:02:00,450
I can do a down or a se in this case that represents the ball going down 83 and then a D is a key code

32
00:02:00,450 --> 00:02:01,440
of 68.

33
00:02:02,100 --> 00:02:06,240
Now, we don't really have to just click and press these different keys all day and look at the key

34
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:08,880
code to figure out which key triggers, which key code.

35
00:02:08,910 --> 00:02:10,500
We can always do a Google search.

36
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:12,990
We can look up JavaScript key code.

37
00:02:14,740 --> 00:02:17,530
One of the first results here is key code info.

38
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:22,290
This is a really great little site to figure out exactly what the key codes are for each key press.

39
00:02:22,300 --> 00:02:30,490
So if I do a W, it'll tell me, Hey, that's 87 left is 65 down 83 right is 68.

40
00:02:32,330 --> 00:02:36,500
So back inside of my editor, I'm going to remove the console log.

41
00:02:37,590 --> 00:02:40,170
And I'm going to instead set up a couple of if statements.

42
00:02:40,170 --> 00:02:45,870
So I'll say if events key code equals and what's the first one we should do?

43
00:02:45,870 --> 00:02:47,670
Let's do up, which is a W.

44
00:02:47,940 --> 00:02:51,510
So if a user has a key code of 87, that means they want to go up.

45
00:02:52,790 --> 00:03:00,290
So inside of here I'll say console.log, move all up and then I can repeat that same process for the

46
00:03:00,290 --> 00:03:01,040
other keys.

47
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:02,900
So I'll duplicate that if statement down.

48
00:03:04,040 --> 00:03:06,410
Once, twice, three times.

49
00:03:07,980 --> 00:03:09,030
So that's up.

50
00:03:09,150 --> 00:03:11,220
I'll make this one a move to the right.

51
00:03:11,550 --> 00:03:13,760
Down and left.

52
00:03:13,770 --> 00:03:16,620
And we can just update the key codes for those appropriate directions.

53
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:20,330
So to move the ball right, I want to find my D key.

54
00:03:20,340 --> 00:03:21,450
So that's 68.

55
00:03:22,190 --> 00:03:24,590
So update the 87 right there to 68.

56
00:03:25,220 --> 00:03:27,080
Going down would be 83.

57
00:03:29,410 --> 00:03:31,750
And going left would be 65.

58
00:03:34,750 --> 00:03:34,960
Yes.

59
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:35,860
Let's save this.

60
00:03:36,370 --> 00:03:37,810
I'll go back over to my application.

61
00:03:37,810 --> 00:03:43,780
I'll refresh and I can once again click inside of my application frame and then I'll go up.

62
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:47,700
Right down and left.

63
00:03:48,210 --> 00:03:52,560
And I can definitely see that I'm doing the appropriate console logs for each of those different directions.

64
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:54,510
So this is definitely good.

65
00:03:54,510 --> 00:03:55,980
Looks like we have a good start here.

66
00:03:55,980 --> 00:03:57,270
So quick pause right here.

67
00:03:57,270 --> 00:04:01,890
We'll come back to the next video and we're going to figure out exactly how we can take these directions

68
00:04:01,890 --> 00:04:05,430
and actually translate them to adding some movement to our ball right there.

69
00:04:05,790 --> 00:04:08,100
So another quick pause and I'll see you in just a minute.
