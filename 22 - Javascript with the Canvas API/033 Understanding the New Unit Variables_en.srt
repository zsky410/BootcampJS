1
00:00:00,760 --> 00:00:01,800
All right, let's get to it.

2
00:00:01,810 --> 00:00:05,050
We're going to start to discuss some of the different variables we need to change inside of here to

3
00:00:05,050 --> 00:00:06,970
get our map to display correctly.

4
00:00:07,540 --> 00:00:09,100
So a quick diagram.

5
00:00:09,610 --> 00:00:11,950
So this is the kind of maze we want to allow the user to have.

6
00:00:11,950 --> 00:00:17,740
Now, I want to not only allow the entire canvas to be rectangular, but I want the number of cells

7
00:00:17,740 --> 00:00:21,160
in the horizontal and vertical direction to be able to vary as well.

8
00:00:22,020 --> 00:00:26,910
So we're going to introduce two new variables that are going to replace the single cells variable that

9
00:00:26,910 --> 00:00:27,750
we have right now.

10
00:00:28,020 --> 00:00:30,480
Remember, cells right now tells us the number of cells.

11
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:33,540
So we want to have both in the horizontal and vertical direction.

12
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:37,970
But now I want to to have a variable number in the horizontal.

13
00:00:38,730 --> 00:00:40,560
And vertical instead.

14
00:00:41,100 --> 00:00:44,220
So we're going to introduce a variable called cells.

15
00:00:45,450 --> 00:00:46,260
Horizontal.

16
00:00:49,040 --> 00:00:54,020
In this case, it would be equal to four because I want to have one, two, three, four cells going

17
00:00:54,020 --> 00:00:55,040
from left to right.

18
00:00:55,490 --> 00:00:57,260
We're also going to have cells.

19
00:00:58,080 --> 00:00:58,830
Vertical.

20
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:03,280
And in this case, as you would guess, one, two, three.

21
00:01:04,290 --> 00:01:07,910
Let's create both those variables right now and we'll discuss exactly how we're going to actually use

22
00:01:07,910 --> 00:01:08,240
them.

23
00:01:09,640 --> 00:01:10,500
It's about over here.

24
00:01:10,510 --> 00:01:16,060
I'm going to remove the cells variable and I'm going to create cells horizontal.

25
00:01:16,900 --> 00:01:22,630
Well started off as four and cells vertical and I'll start that off as three.

26
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:26,810
The next variable I want to point out to you is unit length right here.

27
00:01:26,840 --> 00:01:32,030
Remember, that was supposed to be the length of one side of a given cell, either the height or the

28
00:01:32,030 --> 00:01:33,890
width, because they were always identical.

29
00:01:35,340 --> 00:01:40,500
Now that you're allowing for a very different number of cells in the horizontal and vertical direction

30
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:44,580
and the actual screen space allocated to this can be variable as well.

31
00:01:44,610 --> 00:01:52,590
We need to calculate the horizontal difference or distance of a cell differently from the vertical height

32
00:01:52,620 --> 00:01:53,370
of a cell.

33
00:01:53,670 --> 00:01:56,410
So we're going to introduce two other variables as well.

34
00:01:56,430 --> 00:01:59,990
One will be unit length.

35
00:02:01,290 --> 00:02:04,980
X and the other will be unit length.

36
00:02:06,520 --> 00:02:07,310
Why?

37
00:02:07,480 --> 00:02:13,930
And as you would guess, that's going to be the X direction or the width of a cell and the height of

38
00:02:13,930 --> 00:02:14,500
a cell.

39
00:02:15,660 --> 00:02:21,000
You can calculate both of these by taking advantage of the height and width of the overall canvas and

40
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:25,020
dividing that by the number of cells on the horizontal and the vertical direction.

41
00:02:26,890 --> 00:02:27,670
So back over here.

42
00:02:27,670 --> 00:02:33,220
I'm going to change the existing unit length to unit length Y and then to calculate that we're going

43
00:02:33,220 --> 00:02:38,770
to take the overall width of our canvas and divide by the number of cells in the horizontal direction.

44
00:02:38,770 --> 00:02:40,990
So that is cells horizontal.

45
00:02:41,950 --> 00:02:43,360
So I'll say it sells.

46
00:02:44,340 --> 00:02:46,050
Horizontal like so.

47
00:02:47,100 --> 00:02:53,250
Then for the unit length in the Y direction, I'll create unit length Y, and that's going to be the

48
00:02:53,250 --> 00:02:57,420
overall height of the canvas divided by cells vertical.

49
00:02:58,660 --> 00:02:59,770
And that's pretty much it.

50
00:03:00,950 --> 00:03:01,250
Okay.

51
00:03:01,250 --> 00:03:05,030
So now that we've established the meaning of these different variables, we're going to start to go

52
00:03:05,030 --> 00:03:11,420
around this file and update all the different references we had previously to unit length or cells to

53
00:03:11,420 --> 00:03:15,470
either use cells horizontal vertical or unit length X or y.

54
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:18,410
That refactor is going to be just a little bit painful.

55
00:03:18,410 --> 00:03:20,690
And I want to put all of it into one single video.

56
00:03:20,690 --> 00:03:25,400
So pause right here, come back to the next video and we'll do the entire refactor, hopefully in one

57
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:26,240
single go.
