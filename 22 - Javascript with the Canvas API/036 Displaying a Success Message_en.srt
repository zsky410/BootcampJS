1
00:00:00,830 --> 00:00:01,130
All right.

2
00:00:01,130 --> 00:00:04,880
In this video, we're going to make sure that we show a really big sign on the very center of the screen

3
00:00:04,880 --> 00:00:08,210
that tells the user that they won once they actually will win.

4
00:00:08,750 --> 00:00:12,140
So to do so, I'm going to go back over to my index HTML file.

5
00:00:13,630 --> 00:00:14,320
Inside of here.

6
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:18,460
We're going to add in a development with an H one inside of it.

7
00:00:18,910 --> 00:00:23,470
Now, as a quick reminder, hey, I said a billion times, this course is all about the JavaScript.

8
00:00:23,470 --> 00:00:25,540
So this is mostly all about styling.

9
00:00:25,540 --> 00:00:28,810
So we're going to kind of speed through a little bit of styling to make sure that this message shows

10
00:00:28,810 --> 00:00:30,130
up in the correct location.

11
00:00:30,730 --> 00:00:37,270
So right above my script tag, I'll add a div with the class of winner and hidden.

12
00:00:40,140 --> 00:00:42,330
And then inside the div I'll place an h one.

13
00:00:43,700 --> 00:00:45,860
That says you win.

14
00:00:47,110 --> 00:00:51,370
Then inside my style tag right here, I'm going to add in some styling properties to just style that

15
00:00:51,370 --> 00:00:51,670
thing.

16
00:00:51,670 --> 00:00:55,930
So first selector I'm going to add in is for the hidden class.

17
00:00:56,170 --> 00:01:00,550
So I'm going to say that if an element has the hidden class, then I don't want it to be displayed at

18
00:01:00,550 --> 00:01:00,850
all.

19
00:01:00,850 --> 00:01:06,400
So I'll say display non important to make sure 100% this thing should not show up on the screen.

20
00:01:07,670 --> 00:01:09,350
And then go in to select the H one.

21
00:01:11,210 --> 00:01:13,340
I'm going to give it a colour of white.

22
00:01:14,170 --> 00:01:15,700
And a font size.

23
00:01:17,210 --> 00:01:20,990
How about 36 pixels, nice and large.

24
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:27,470
And then finally, to get this thing centered, I'm going to select the winner class.

25
00:01:28,550 --> 00:01:30,350
So that's essentially this dive right here.

26
00:01:31,880 --> 00:01:34,180
Now I'm going to add on a couple of different rules to it.

27
00:01:34,180 --> 00:01:36,160
So I'm going to say display a flex.

28
00:01:36,950 --> 00:01:45,590
I'll add on a justify content to justify dash content of center and a line dash items of center.

29
00:01:45,590 --> 00:01:48,140
So that's what it's going to get it to be centered on the screen.

30
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,190
I'll give it a position of absolute.

31
00:01:53,470 --> 00:01:57,970
And a Z index of one to make sure that it shows up on top of our canvas element.

32
00:01:58,540 --> 00:02:01,420
And then finally, I'll give it a height of 100.

33
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:08,830
VH and a width of 100 VW, and that's going to make sure that it stretches out the full height and width

34
00:02:08,830 --> 00:02:09,580
of the screen.

35
00:02:12,440 --> 00:02:12,890
It's enough.

36
00:02:12,890 --> 00:02:13,730
We save this.

37
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:17,720
No need to go refresh, because right now, if we refresh, we're not going to see anything because

38
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:19,270
we've got the hidden class on there.

39
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:23,180
And remember, the hidden class hides that div and everything inside of it.

40
00:02:23,900 --> 00:02:28,190
So now in order to show this message to our user, once they've hit our win condition, we just have

41
00:02:28,190 --> 00:02:33,230
to select this element and remove the hidden class that will get that div and the h one side of it to

42
00:02:33,230 --> 00:02:34,010
be displayed.

43
00:02:34,860 --> 00:02:37,440
So for that, I'll go back over to my index case file.

44
00:02:37,890 --> 00:02:41,550
I'm going to go down to the very bottom where we are handling our win condition right now.

45
00:02:42,900 --> 00:02:46,920
And then inside of our if statement I'll add in a selector.

46
00:02:47,310 --> 00:02:49,410
So document query selector.

47
00:02:51,130 --> 00:02:53,950
I'm going to select the element with a class of winner.

48
00:02:58,020 --> 00:02:59,610
I'll get the class list.

49
00:03:00,970 --> 00:03:04,030
And I will remove the class of hidden.

50
00:03:09,130 --> 00:03:10,900
All right, I'm going to save both these files.

51
00:03:11,900 --> 00:03:12,950
I'll go back over.

52
00:03:13,310 --> 00:03:14,120
I'll refresh.

53
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:16,040
So I don't see anything on the screen right away.

54
00:03:16,070 --> 00:03:21,320
I'm going to change my maze dimensions so you don't have to sit here and watch me solve this maze forever.

55
00:03:21,320 --> 00:03:26,570
So really quickly I'm going to change to cells horizontal of, I don't know, six and vertical of four.

56
00:03:27,390 --> 00:03:27,710
There we go.

57
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:28,980
Nice and easy to solve.

58
00:03:29,010 --> 00:03:30,600
So now I can go on over.

59
00:03:32,430 --> 00:03:33,150
Solve it.

60
00:03:33,150 --> 00:03:34,110
And there we go.

61
00:03:34,140 --> 00:03:35,370
I see you in.

62
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,430
I think that text could be a little bit larger.

63
00:03:38,430 --> 00:03:39,330
So what the heck?

64
00:03:39,330 --> 00:03:42,660
I'm going to dial up that font size inside of our style tag right here.

65
00:03:42,930 --> 00:03:45,000
I'll go to just a I don't know.

66
00:03:45,830 --> 00:03:47,330
64 arbitrarily.

67
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:49,200
Save that.

68
00:03:52,140 --> 00:03:53,280
When again.

69
00:03:53,730 --> 00:03:55,650
And that's good enough, I'd say.

70
00:03:56,260 --> 00:03:57,330
Okay, so that's pretty much it.

71
00:03:57,330 --> 00:03:58,680
That is our maze game.

72
00:03:58,710 --> 00:04:02,580
The only downside to this thing is that once a user wins, they essentially can't do it, do anything

73
00:04:02,580 --> 00:04:04,080
else until they refresh.

74
00:04:04,350 --> 00:04:10,080
So one way you could easily fix that is to just add in a button, maybe to recall or wrap all the code

75
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:13,230
we wrote together and throw that all into a function.

76
00:04:13,230 --> 00:04:18,269
And then once the user wins, maybe show a button that a user can click to build out the entire grid

77
00:04:18,269 --> 00:04:20,420
and verticals and all that kind of stuff again.

78
00:04:20,430 --> 00:04:23,010
But I'm going to leave that up as a exercise to you.

79
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:27,030
Give me something that you can implement on your own if you want to, because we've definitely spent

80
00:04:27,030 --> 00:04:29,730
a pretty good amount of time on this application already.

81
00:04:30,690 --> 00:04:31,970
So I hope you enjoyed this app.

82
00:04:31,980 --> 00:04:34,140
I think that it looks pretty interesting.

83
00:04:34,140 --> 00:04:36,660
And hey, who doesn't like a good maze to play around with?

84
00:04:37,230 --> 00:04:40,470
So let's take a break here and continue on the next video.
