1
00:00:00,680 --> 00:00:05,000
In this video, we're going to look at some different diagrams to understand how to calculate the different

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:07,670
dimensions that we're going to pass into the rectangle function.

3
00:00:08,380 --> 00:00:12,700
So the first thing I want to do is go back up to the top of the file all the way at the top.

4
00:00:12,700 --> 00:00:16,990
I just want to remind you very quickly that we've got a couple of different constant variables declared

5
00:00:16,990 --> 00:00:17,650
right here.

6
00:00:18,220 --> 00:00:22,660
We've got cells, which is the number of cells in either the horizontal or vertical direction.

7
00:00:22,810 --> 00:00:24,670
And then we've got a width and height.

8
00:00:24,670 --> 00:00:29,470
And very critically right now we are seeing that the height and width are always going to be identical

9
00:00:29,470 --> 00:00:30,280
to each other.

10
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:34,540
Eventually, we're going to allow these two values to vary to get a rectangular maze.

11
00:00:34,540 --> 00:00:38,110
But for right now, they are always going to be perfectly the same.

12
00:00:38,710 --> 00:00:44,560
So if we think about these, the combination of these two dimensions together, we can start to imagine

13
00:00:44,560 --> 00:00:51,730
that at the end of the day, every cell is going to be 200 units wide because 600 divided by three is

14
00:00:51,730 --> 00:00:52,570
200.

15
00:00:53,170 --> 00:00:57,550
So I'm going to define a little variable underneath here called unit length.

16
00:00:59,070 --> 00:01:04,349
Unit length is essentially saying that every cell that I create is going to be this many units tall

17
00:01:04,349 --> 00:01:05,970
and this many units wide.

18
00:01:06,420 --> 00:01:12,750
So to calculate the unit width or something, the unit length, we would do a width divided by cells.

19
00:01:13,290 --> 00:01:15,630
And of course, we could do height instead.

20
00:01:15,660 --> 00:01:19,530
It really doesn't matter right now because again, height, width are always going to be identical.

21
00:01:20,490 --> 00:01:25,560
So again, unit length is going to be the length of one side of one of our cells.

22
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:28,050
So just keep that variable in mind for half a second.

23
00:01:28,050 --> 00:01:32,430
We're going to need to use that variable in order to figure out how to draw our individual walls.

24
00:01:33,510 --> 00:01:37,710
So I'm going to go over to a quick diagram and let's draw some stuff out here.

25
00:01:38,490 --> 00:01:41,760
Right now, we are iterating over our horizontals array.

26
00:01:42,330 --> 00:01:44,580
We know that that is going to be a 2D array.

27
00:01:45,540 --> 00:01:47,640
It's going to have the two different rows.

28
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:57,150
To represent that row and that row right there, each of those different well segments, I'm going to

29
00:01:57,150 --> 00:01:58,860
throw some imaginary values in here.

30
00:01:58,860 --> 00:02:02,250
So I'm going to say maybe we've got true, false, true.

31
00:02:03,090 --> 00:02:03,730
False.

32
00:02:03,750 --> 00:02:04,580
True.

33
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:05,520
False.

34
00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:11,530
So now, if I wanted to reflect what actual walls we need to draw, I'm going to erase a couple elements

35
00:02:11,530 --> 00:02:11,980
here.

36
00:02:12,920 --> 00:02:14,990
So we would have no wall right there.

37
00:02:15,780 --> 00:02:17,700
We would have no wall right there.

38
00:02:19,090 --> 00:02:22,120
And then we would have no wall right there.

39
00:02:23,510 --> 00:02:29,240
Now using that information, we need to somehow figure out how we can draw this rectangle.

40
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:31,790
This rectangle and this rectangle.

41
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:36,690
We're going to first focus on how to draw the one at the top, this one right here.

42
00:02:37,320 --> 00:02:43,230
So we need to figure out how to go from our origin point, which, remember, is on the top left corner.

43
00:02:43,230 --> 00:02:45,150
That is our zero zero.

44
00:02:45,930 --> 00:02:52,920
We need to first figure out how far over we need to go to get the center point of that rectangle.

45
00:02:53,550 --> 00:02:56,460
And then we also need to figure out how far down we need to go.

46
00:02:58,990 --> 00:03:01,960
To get the center point as well in the vertical direction.

47
00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:05,680
So in other words, we need to figure out what that is right there.

48
00:03:07,450 --> 00:03:07,900
Okay.

49
00:03:07,930 --> 00:03:12,550
So when we think about the Y dimension, so this off here, it's the left hand side.

50
00:03:12,550 --> 00:03:16,330
We're essentially saying that we want to go down the height of one cell.

51
00:03:16,660 --> 00:03:20,890
So that is why we just created that unit length variable to get the center point right there, we're

52
00:03:20,890 --> 00:03:23,470
going to first go down unit.

53
00:03:24,460 --> 00:03:25,270
Length.

54
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:31,610
So in our case, that is going to be the whatever it was, was it 200 pixels?

55
00:03:31,610 --> 00:03:33,620
So we'd be going down 200 units.

56
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:37,490
That'd be the center point right there on the vertical direction.

57
00:03:38,610 --> 00:03:41,100
Then the x direction to that center point.

58
00:03:41,100 --> 00:03:48,270
So this horizontal direction would be one and a half cells over.

59
00:03:48,690 --> 00:03:50,880
So that would be unit length.

60
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:57,480
Times 1.5.

61
00:03:58,770 --> 00:04:03,270
So that's how we're going to figure out how we get to the center point of that segment right there.

62
00:04:04,130 --> 00:04:08,840
But just doing like unit length times 1.5 isn't super useful because if we start to think about how

63
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:14,210
to show these other ones like that segment or that segment, well, it's very clear that this is not

64
00:04:14,210 --> 00:04:19,970
just a function of the unit length, but it's also a function of what row these center points or these

65
00:04:19,970 --> 00:04:22,850
segments are occurring on and what column as well.

66
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:27,560
So in other words, as we start to think about how did the center point of that next one down, it's

67
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:28,640
going to actually be.

68
00:04:29,760 --> 00:04:31,110
Unit length.

69
00:04:32,070 --> 00:04:34,080
Times two.

70
00:04:34,230 --> 00:04:40,560
So how do we kind of calculate that distance right there based on the unit length and what row it is

71
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:43,380
on and what column it is on?

72
00:04:43,590 --> 00:04:48,090
Well, let me just show you the math, give you an idea of how this is all going to work out in order

73
00:04:48,090 --> 00:04:53,910
to get these center points of all these horizontal segments, we need to get the column.

74
00:04:55,930 --> 00:04:56,860
Index.

75
00:04:57,720 --> 00:04:59,430
Though we are currently working on.

76
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:04,650
So in this case, for the top one that we were just discussing, let me do some deletion here.

77
00:05:07,940 --> 00:05:15,800
So for the top element, this one again are right here we are operating on column index zero one.

78
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:20,990
So one in this case and we are operating on row index zero.

79
00:05:22,300 --> 00:05:24,160
So we need to do the column index.

80
00:05:25,570 --> 00:05:26,440
Times.

81
00:05:27,410 --> 00:05:28,880
Our unit length.

82
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:33,060
Plus.

83
00:05:34,130 --> 00:05:35,270
Unit length.

84
00:05:37,590 --> 00:05:38,580
Divided by two.

85
00:05:39,340 --> 00:05:46,690
So that's what is going to give us the direction or the distance like so we can try to use this equation

86
00:05:46,690 --> 00:05:50,770
right here to figure out the X direction for each of these different segments.

87
00:05:50,770 --> 00:05:54,430
So for example, if you want to figure out the X direction distance for this one on the bottom left,

88
00:05:54,430 --> 00:05:59,080
right here, that would be column index of zero.

89
00:05:59,530 --> 00:06:04,810
So we would do zero plus 200 or three times 200.

90
00:06:07,690 --> 00:06:09,460
Zero times 200.

91
00:06:10,490 --> 00:06:11,180
Plus.

92
00:06:11,990 --> 00:06:16,160
200 divided by two, which equals 100.

93
00:06:16,580 --> 00:06:21,770
So that means that we would have 100 units over to get to the X direction at Center Point.

94
00:06:22,490 --> 00:06:26,450
So if we want to try to apply that formula again for this original one right here.

95
00:06:27,290 --> 00:06:32,630
That would be our column index, which in this case is one times 200.

96
00:06:33,650 --> 00:06:36,170
Plus 200 divided by two.

97
00:06:36,650 --> 00:06:39,230
And that gives us 300, which is definitely correct.

98
00:06:39,380 --> 00:06:43,970
And then finally, for the last one down here, that would be a column index of two.

99
00:06:44,920 --> 00:06:46,240
Times 200.

100
00:06:47,390 --> 00:06:49,820
Plus 200 over two.

101
00:06:50,510 --> 00:06:52,100
And that would give us, what, 500?

102
00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:59,110
Which is correct as well, because overall we've got 600, so we essentially want to go back 100 units.

103
00:06:59,140 --> 00:07:00,640
That would be 500.

104
00:07:01,750 --> 00:07:03,010
To that center point right there.

105
00:07:03,010 --> 00:07:04,690
Again in the X direction.

106
00:07:05,140 --> 00:07:09,220
Now that we've got that first little formula, let's try to write out that code back when we create

107
00:07:09,220 --> 00:07:12,190
our rectangle and we'll think about the vertical direction after that.

108
00:07:12,610 --> 00:07:18,670
So on body start rectangle, the x coordinate here will be at column index.

109
00:07:20,970 --> 00:07:22,590
Times the unit length.

110
00:07:25,270 --> 00:07:28,540
Plus the unit length divided by two.

111
00:07:28,810 --> 00:07:31,600
Now, we don't have any variables inside of here called column index.

112
00:07:31,900 --> 00:07:37,060
So how do we figure out what kind of column we are currently iterating over and what row we are iterating

113
00:07:37,060 --> 00:07:37,900
over as well?

114
00:07:38,020 --> 00:07:41,680
We'll remember the second argument inside the for each functions.

115
00:07:41,710 --> 00:07:44,740
The first argument is the actual value where we are iterating over.

116
00:07:44,770 --> 00:07:47,830
The second argument is the index of that element.

117
00:07:48,070 --> 00:07:52,930
So for row right here, we would also have a second argument of row index and that tells us what row

118
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:54,250
we are currently operating on.

119
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:57,040
And for the second one, we have the column index.

120
00:07:57,040 --> 00:07:59,230
That is what column we are currently iterating on.

121
00:08:00,690 --> 00:08:03,960
Now we can repeat the same process for the Y direction as well.

122
00:08:04,660 --> 00:08:06,310
So I'm going to do a little bit of erasure.

123
00:08:09,960 --> 00:08:10,380
Okay.

124
00:08:16,090 --> 00:08:17,350
Well, a little bit more.

125
00:08:21,510 --> 00:08:24,360
And I'm going to draw in a couple more segments here by hand.

126
00:08:24,570 --> 00:08:25,320
There we go.

127
00:08:25,890 --> 00:08:27,630
So now we want to get.

128
00:08:29,070 --> 00:08:32,760
That segment, that segment and that segment.

129
00:08:32,760 --> 00:08:33,870
And now we're talking about this.

130
00:08:33,870 --> 00:08:34,679
Why direction?

131
00:08:34,679 --> 00:08:37,350
So how far down do we want to get this thing?

132
00:08:37,860 --> 00:08:40,440
Let's first think about this segment right here.

133
00:08:40,830 --> 00:08:45,600
So how do we get that segment based upon our row index column index and our unit length?

134
00:08:45,780 --> 00:08:48,510
Well, in this case, it is going to be our ROE index.

135
00:08:48,510 --> 00:08:52,860
So that is going to be like this direction or this row right here, which is our first row.

136
00:08:53,070 --> 00:08:56,040
So it's going to be our row index.

137
00:08:58,220 --> 00:09:00,350
Times the unit length.

138
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:07,090
And in this case, it's going to be plus the unit length.

139
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:14,450
So let's try to plug in some numbers to get the Y coordinate or the Y direction to that center point

140
00:09:14,450 --> 00:09:15,200
right there.

141
00:09:16,260 --> 00:09:18,600
So I would do a row index of one.

142
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:24,630
Times are unit length of 200 plus hour unit length of 200.

143
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:26,500
And that would be 400.

144
00:09:26,520 --> 00:09:30,960
So that means to draw out the Y coordinate of this wall right here.

145
00:09:30,960 --> 00:09:32,640
It would be 400 units.

146
00:09:33,780 --> 00:09:35,430
And if we think about this one right here.

147
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:39,730
That would be a row index in this case of zero.

148
00:09:40,090 --> 00:09:46,260
So zero times the unit length of 200 plus 200 gives us 200.

149
00:09:46,280 --> 00:09:48,850
Does that means go down 200 units to get that one?

150
00:09:48,940 --> 00:09:52,850
And then this one right here is the same math as that one that we did just a moment ago.

151
00:09:52,870 --> 00:09:56,740
So that would be on rho index of one times 200.

152
00:09:57,480 --> 00:10:00,990
Plus 200 gives us 400 again.

153
00:10:02,050 --> 00:10:02,320
All right.

154
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:05,830
So I know that this math is kind of nasty, but this is pretty much what has to be done.

155
00:10:05,830 --> 00:10:08,290
So, hey, we got to talk about it one way or another.

156
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:13,060
So now let's write out the equation where the Y coordinate of this rectangle as well.

157
00:10:13,090 --> 00:10:17,440
So I'll put a comma in and then we're going to get row index times.

158
00:10:18,940 --> 00:10:22,540
The unit length plus the unit length.

159
00:10:24,520 --> 00:10:24,650
Okay.

160
00:10:24,760 --> 00:10:28,180
Now that the third and fourth arguments, these are going to be way easier.

161
00:10:28,180 --> 00:10:32,170
So this is going to be how wide and how tall we want the rectangle to be.

162
00:10:32,500 --> 00:10:39,130
So in this case, we know that we want our wall to be like that long, like whatever the width of one

163
00:10:39,130 --> 00:10:39,670
cell is.

164
00:10:39,670 --> 00:10:41,650
That's how long we want it to be.

165
00:10:42,840 --> 00:10:44,940
And that is the direction in the x axis.

166
00:10:44,940 --> 00:10:47,130
So that is going to be the third argument right here.

167
00:10:47,520 --> 00:10:50,250
We want that to be unit length units long.

168
00:10:50,250 --> 00:10:54,240
So essentially the width of one cell and that is what unit length represents.

169
00:10:55,820 --> 00:10:59,990
And then the fourth argument is going to be how tall we want the wall to be.

170
00:10:59,990 --> 00:11:05,090
So essentially, like, is it going to be really tall like that or is it going to be just very, very

171
00:11:05,090 --> 00:11:07,100
thin, like almost appearing to be a line?

172
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:09,350
Well, we can just throw in some test value.

173
00:11:09,350 --> 00:11:11,390
I'm going to use like a fixed value of ten here.

174
00:11:11,390 --> 00:11:14,330
So I'm going to say that my wall is going to be ten units tall.

175
00:11:16,400 --> 00:11:16,670
All right.

176
00:11:16,670 --> 00:11:21,940
So finally, a last argument to the rectangle creation.

177
00:11:21,950 --> 00:11:26,720
We're going to make sure that we also mark this thing as static so that it doesn't kind of fly all around

178
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:28,280
once we start to draw it on the screen.

179
00:11:28,280 --> 00:11:29,990
So let's say is static is true.

180
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:35,820
So now that we've created that wall, we can add it into our world.

181
00:11:36,180 --> 00:11:39,900
And to add in that shape, we will call world add.

182
00:11:40,660 --> 00:11:43,150
We're going to add to the world object we had created earlier.

183
00:11:43,780 --> 00:11:45,700
And I want to add this wall.

184
00:11:47,400 --> 00:11:47,810
Okay.

185
00:11:47,820 --> 00:11:52,020
I know this has been some nasty math, but like I said, we had to go through it.

186
00:11:52,140 --> 00:11:54,540
So now that we've got that done, I'll save the file.

187
00:11:54,570 --> 00:11:59,250
I'm going to go back over and do a quick test and I can see one wall up here, right there.

188
00:11:59,610 --> 00:12:03,120
Now I can refresh this and every time I'm going to see some walls up here in different locations to

189
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:06,180
represent kind of like the randomness of the maze we are creating.

190
00:12:07,650 --> 00:12:07,840
Okay.

191
00:12:07,900 --> 00:12:11,550
So that's definitely working correctly, or at least I think it's working correctly.

192
00:12:11,550 --> 00:12:15,390
We won't know for sure until we also draw in the vertical segments as well.

193
00:12:15,900 --> 00:12:17,250
So I bet you could guess what's next.

194
00:12:17,250 --> 00:12:18,510
Let's take a quick pause right here.

195
00:12:18,510 --> 00:12:19,800
We're going to come back to the next video.

196
00:12:19,800 --> 00:12:24,150
We're going to add in some very similar looking code to handle the creation of all the vertical wall

197
00:12:24,150 --> 00:12:24,810
segments.

198
00:12:24,810 --> 00:12:30,120
And once we start to add that stuff in, then we will note that our maze for sure is working correctly.

199
00:12:30,330 --> 00:12:33,000
So a quick pause and we'll take care of verticals in the next video.
