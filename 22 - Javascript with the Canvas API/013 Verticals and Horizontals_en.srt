1
00:00:00,560 --> 00:00:04,190
In this video, we're going to generate our verticals array and our horizontals array.

2
00:00:04,220 --> 00:00:06,680
Once again, quick reminder on what both those do.

3
00:00:07,360 --> 00:00:09,820
So we have our verticals.

4
00:00:12,220 --> 00:00:14,320
Array and horizontals.

5
00:00:17,950 --> 00:00:21,460
The vertical array is going to keep track of every vertical while we have.

6
00:00:21,460 --> 00:00:23,860
So those right there.

7
00:00:24,520 --> 00:00:29,500
Remember that these arrays are going to have some different dimensions than the grid array.

8
00:00:29,620 --> 00:00:36,160
So in this case, if we have a three by three, the verticals which only represents those labeled segments

9
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:38,290
right there is going to have.

10
00:00:39,110 --> 00:00:39,920
Three rows.

11
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:41,360
So there is one row.

12
00:00:42,120 --> 00:00:43,560
There is row to.

13
00:00:44,440 --> 00:00:45,550
And Row three.

14
00:00:46,340 --> 00:00:49,070
But in that side of there, it's going to have two columns.

15
00:00:49,070 --> 00:00:54,500
So to start off, you would have false, false, false, false, false and false.

16
00:00:55,040 --> 00:00:59,300
So then if we start it off randomly right there and decided to move right there, we would find the

17
00:00:59,300 --> 00:01:03,080
corresponding entry inside of verticals that represents that wall segment.

18
00:01:03,080 --> 00:01:04,940
So that would be that one right there.

19
00:01:06,250 --> 00:01:09,820
We would take out that false and update it to true instead.

20
00:01:11,650 --> 00:01:14,050
So then horizontals is very similar nature.

21
00:01:14,440 --> 00:01:16,430
Horizontals is going to keep track.

22
00:01:16,450 --> 00:01:20,140
Let's change the green here of all these horizontal segments.

23
00:01:21,770 --> 00:01:24,920
So likewise, it's also going to start off as a 2D array.

24
00:01:26,410 --> 00:01:28,060
It's going to have two rows.

25
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:30,940
So Row one and row two.

26
00:01:31,240 --> 00:01:33,840
And then inside those two rows it will have three columns.

27
00:01:33,850 --> 00:01:36,490
So we have false, false, false.

28
00:01:38,500 --> 00:01:39,250
Like so.

29
00:01:39,430 --> 00:01:43,480
So then we can imagine if we started off in this cell right here on the very bottom left hand side,

30
00:01:43,480 --> 00:01:45,910
the matching element inside of our horizontals array.

31
00:01:45,940 --> 00:01:47,050
Is that right there?

32
00:01:47,260 --> 00:01:48,610
If we then go up.

33
00:01:49,290 --> 00:01:50,730
We would change that.

34
00:01:52,780 --> 00:01:59,370
Too true to say that there is now an opening right there which would represent something like that.

35
00:01:59,380 --> 00:02:00,040
Like so.

36
00:02:01,420 --> 00:02:01,600
Okay.

37
00:02:01,660 --> 00:02:04,090
So with this reminder, let's now go back over to our code.

38
00:02:04,090 --> 00:02:06,280
We're going to create verticals and horizontals.

39
00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:10,090
And again, the big thing we have to keep aware of or stay aware of here is that these are going to

40
00:02:10,090 --> 00:02:12,820
have slightly different dimensions than the grid array.

41
00:02:13,890 --> 00:02:14,120
Yes.

42
00:02:14,190 --> 00:02:14,900
Back over.

43
00:02:14,910 --> 00:02:17,880
I'm going to create my array of verticals.

44
00:02:18,880 --> 00:02:20,450
I'm going to create this array inside.

45
00:02:20,470 --> 00:02:22,690
We're with the same style that we use just a moment ago.

46
00:02:22,990 --> 00:02:25,030
So for verticals, I'm going to make an array.

47
00:02:26,320 --> 00:02:30,130
As we just discussed, this thing is going to have three rows inside of it.

48
00:02:30,130 --> 00:02:34,810
So the outer array is going to have length three because one, two and three.

49
00:02:36,010 --> 00:02:36,790
So back over here.

50
00:02:36,790 --> 00:02:38,680
I'm going to create an array with like three.

51
00:02:39,870 --> 00:02:41,730
And then going to fill that up with NULL.

52
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:44,190
And then map over those values.

53
00:02:45,790 --> 00:02:47,650
And inside, I'll create a new array.

54
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:49,280
And here's where things get interesting.

55
00:02:49,300 --> 00:02:54,820
The inner array is going to have length to this array right here, two elements to it.

56
00:02:55,420 --> 00:03:00,460
So I'm going to make sure that I do a map and I'm going to get an array with two elements inside, and

57
00:03:00,460 --> 00:03:03,520
I'm going to fill that thing up with a value of false like so.

58
00:03:04,820 --> 00:03:08,310
So now I can repeat the same process for horizontals as well.

59
00:03:09,270 --> 00:03:10,860
So I'll do an array here.

60
00:03:11,540 --> 00:03:17,990
Once again, horizontals is only going to have two rows, so the outer array will have two elements

61
00:03:17,990 --> 00:03:18,560
to it.

62
00:03:19,690 --> 00:03:21,190
I'm going to fill that up.

63
00:03:22,070 --> 00:03:24,020
With any old value because we're going to replace it.

64
00:03:24,020 --> 00:03:24,920
In just a moment.

65
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:26,210
I'm going to map.

66
00:03:28,150 --> 00:03:30,560
I'll do an array and I bet you can guess what goes there.

67
00:03:30,580 --> 00:03:34,240
The inner arrays on horizontals has 1 to 3 elements.

68
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:36,140
So I'm going to go back over.

69
00:03:36,140 --> 00:03:37,880
I'm going to make sure that this thing has three elements.

70
00:03:37,880 --> 00:03:39,980
I'm going to fill that thing up with false.

71
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:45,590
All right, so let's now do a console log of verticals and just make sure we generate the thing correctly.

72
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:47,220
So I'll flip back over refresh.

73
00:03:48,060 --> 00:03:52,680
So I got verticals as the three rows and it's got the two columns for each.

74
00:03:52,890 --> 00:04:00,060
So that maps up perfectly because we are representing that segment, that segment, all these like so.

75
00:04:01,820 --> 00:04:03,410
And then we can update our console log.

76
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:06,270
And instead do a horizontals.

77
00:04:06,690 --> 00:04:07,440
Save it.

78
00:04:08,350 --> 00:04:10,340
Go back over, do the refresh.

79
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:12,280
Check this thing out, Kate.

80
00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:13,350
And this looks good as well.

81
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:18,700
So we're looking at horizontals now, remember, that's going to represent that that that that, that

82
00:04:18,700 --> 00:04:19,420
and that.

83
00:04:20,170 --> 00:04:25,660
And so we definitely want to have row one, row two, and each of those is going to have three false

84
00:04:25,660 --> 00:04:26,860
values inside of it.

85
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:28,730
Okay.

86
00:04:28,730 --> 00:04:31,550
So it looks like we've generated all of our data successfully.

87
00:04:31,580 --> 00:04:35,330
Believe it or not, this right here, this is definitely the hardest part.

88
00:04:35,480 --> 00:04:39,480
Without a doubt, just understanding what the purpose of these arrays.

89
00:04:39,500 --> 00:04:40,930
So now we have this stuff together.

90
00:04:40,940 --> 00:04:44,870
The rest of the code we have to write is actually going to be kind of surprisingly easy.

91
00:04:44,870 --> 00:04:47,510
Believe it or not, it's really not the worst thing in the world.

92
00:04:48,140 --> 00:04:51,170
There is one last change I want to make to this code, however, so quick pause.

93
00:04:51,170 --> 00:04:55,070
We're going to come back and you'll notice we've got the value three and two inside of here all over

94
00:04:55,070 --> 00:04:55,700
the place.

95
00:04:55,700 --> 00:05:00,200
So we're just going to make sure that we abstract that out into a configuration variable, just like

96
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:02,930
we did with height and width up here a little bit ago.

97
00:05:03,080 --> 00:05:05,240
So quick pause and I'll see you in just a minute.
