1
00:00:00,940 --> 00:00:02,940
All right, let's do a little bit of project setup.

2
00:00:02,950 --> 00:00:06,010
I'm inside of a workspace directory of sorts inside of here.

3
00:00:06,010 --> 00:00:08,710
I'm going to make a new directory called Maze.

4
00:00:09,100 --> 00:00:13,210
I'll then change into that directory and then start up my code editor inside there.

5
00:00:15,260 --> 00:00:20,240
Our project set up is going to involve a simple HTML file and a JavaScript file, which is where we're

6
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:22,400
going to write all of our application code.

7
00:00:22,670 --> 00:00:27,830
So inside this new project directory, I'll first make a new file called Indexed HTML.

8
00:00:28,940 --> 00:00:31,100
And I'll throw a little bit of boilerplate in there.

9
00:00:31,850 --> 00:00:33,620
So get my HTML tag.

10
00:00:35,090 --> 00:00:36,080
I'll get ahead.

11
00:00:37,290 --> 00:00:38,370
And a body.

12
00:00:40,860 --> 00:00:45,240
And then a script tag with a source of index dot js.

13
00:00:46,130 --> 00:00:46,880
Like so.

14
00:00:49,350 --> 00:00:52,420
I'm also going to add in a script tag inside the head element.

15
00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:57,120
We're going to use this additional script tag to get access to the matter.

16
00:00:57,120 --> 00:00:58,140
JS Library.

17
00:00:58,500 --> 00:01:02,790
So I need to make sure that I provide a source right here to the Matter Jar Library to get that, I'm

18
00:01:02,790 --> 00:01:04,500
going to go back over to my browser.

19
00:01:04,890 --> 00:01:08,250
I'm going to navigate to see an JSP.

20
00:01:10,310 --> 00:01:13,370
And then once here I'll search for simply matter.

21
00:01:13,970 --> 00:01:15,230
And I should see it matter.

22
00:01:15,230 --> 00:01:17,720
Dash jazz as one of the first results.

23
00:01:18,170 --> 00:01:22,580
So there's a link to the library, so I can highlight that and copy it.

24
00:01:24,670 --> 00:01:26,860
And then put it into the script tag right here.

25
00:01:30,080 --> 00:01:32,660
Let's also make sure we create the index case file.

26
00:01:34,610 --> 00:01:39,020
They'll do a quick console.log and say hi there once again, as usual, just to make sure that everything

27
00:01:39,020 --> 00:01:40,490
is linked up correctly.

28
00:01:41,420 --> 00:01:42,140
So that should be it.

29
00:01:42,170 --> 00:01:45,860
Now we can go ahead and open up that indexed HTML file.

30
00:01:46,760 --> 00:01:47,960
Inside of our browser.

31
00:01:49,230 --> 00:01:50,820
So I'll go back over to my browser.

32
00:01:52,020 --> 00:01:54,270
Open up the HTML file.

33
00:01:55,530 --> 00:02:00,900
Check my console and just make sure that the console log that I added to the indexed HTML file or indexed

34
00:02:01,230 --> 00:02:02,280
file is there.

35
00:02:02,310 --> 00:02:02,700
Yep.

36
00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:03,900
Definitely looks like it is.

37
00:02:04,520 --> 00:02:04,800
Okay.

38
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:07,300
So that's all the setup we have to do, believe it or not.

39
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:07,650
Yep.

40
00:02:07,650 --> 00:02:09,449
Not a lot of stuff going on in that regard.

41
00:02:09,449 --> 00:02:11,070
So let's take a quick pause right here.

42
00:02:11,070 --> 00:02:15,010
When we come back, the next video, we're going to start to discuss the matter JS Library.

43
00:02:15,030 --> 00:02:19,170
We're going to write out a pretty quick example over the next couple of videos to get a better idea

44
00:02:19,170 --> 00:02:20,040
of how it works.

45
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:22,590
And then we'll start to focus on building this maze.
