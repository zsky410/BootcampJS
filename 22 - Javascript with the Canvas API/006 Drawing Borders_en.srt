1
00:00:00,940 --> 00:00:05,380
Rather than start working on our maze application right away, I first want to try to recreate this

2
00:00:05,380 --> 00:00:06,610
demo very quickly.

3
00:00:06,730 --> 00:00:10,390
Making this demo is actually gonna be easier than you might think, and it's going to just get us a

4
00:00:10,390 --> 00:00:14,560
little bit more familiar with matter just before we dive off the deep end and start worrying about Maze

5
00:00:14,560 --> 00:00:17,710
Generation and a bunch of different crazy topics.

6
00:00:18,190 --> 00:00:22,240
So in order to create this demo right here, we're going to create a variety of different shapes.

7
00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:26,140
We need to make sure that they can all be clicked on and dragged around with the mouse.

8
00:00:26,710 --> 00:00:32,110
We also need to make sure that we show four rectangles along the edges of the canvas as well.

9
00:00:32,350 --> 00:00:36,400
So I need one on top, one on the right, one on the bottom and one on the left.

10
00:00:36,820 --> 00:00:41,440
The purpose of these different rectangles is to just keep our shapes from flying off to the outside

11
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:42,010
world.

12
00:00:42,430 --> 00:00:47,860
If we go back over to our application right now and we turn off the is static right there, so I'm going

13
00:00:47,860 --> 00:00:49,630
to comment it out and then refresh.

14
00:00:49,630 --> 00:00:53,470
We saw that our shape can very easily just fall off the face of the earth.

15
00:00:53,470 --> 00:00:58,360
So in order to keep this thing on the screen, we just have to show some rectangles around the border

16
00:00:58,390 --> 00:01:00,130
to make sure that it doesn't fall off.

17
00:01:01,250 --> 00:01:01,430
Okay.

18
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:02,250
So that's pretty much it.

19
00:01:02,270 --> 00:01:07,010
We're going to make sure that we can show a rectangle on the top, right, bottom and left.

20
00:01:08,420 --> 00:01:11,570
So to do so, I'm going to go back over to my index case file.

21
00:01:11,810 --> 00:01:15,560
I'm going to find where I'm creating a rectangle right now, and I'm going to delete it.

22
00:01:16,040 --> 00:01:19,790
And then I will replace that with a comment that says simply Walls.

23
00:01:20,270 --> 00:01:24,620
As we start writing matter G's code, we're going to be creating a variety of different shapes inside

24
00:01:24,620 --> 00:01:27,650
of our index file over and over again.

25
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:32,750
And so it's usually very good practice to add in some comments to describe the bunch of shapes we're

26
00:01:32,750 --> 00:01:37,010
about to add right here, because otherwise it's going to be kind of challenging to remember exactly

27
00:01:37,010 --> 00:01:38,990
what code creates, what shapes.

28
00:01:40,190 --> 00:01:43,580
So then I'm going to create an array called walls like so.

29
00:01:43,970 --> 00:01:47,450
And inside of here, I'm going to create the four different rectangles that we need.

30
00:01:47,870 --> 00:01:52,970
I'm going to first start with the top rectangle, so I'll call bodies dot rectangle.

31
00:01:54,570 --> 00:02:00,360
Remember that the first two arguments are the x and Y coordinates of the center of the rectangle, and

32
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:03,480
the third and fourth are the width and height of the rectangle.

33
00:02:04,140 --> 00:02:08,070
For this very first one, let's take a look at a diagram and just make sure that it's really clear what

34
00:02:08,100 --> 00:02:09,690
numbers we're going to put in here.

35
00:02:10,750 --> 00:02:11,020
Yes.

36
00:02:11,020 --> 00:02:15,150
The rectangle you see right here represents our canvas, as we saw just a moment ago.

37
00:02:15,160 --> 00:02:18,130
Our canvas is 800 units wide.

38
00:02:19,810 --> 00:02:24,280
The rectangle that we want to show is essentially going to be like this right here.

39
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:31,050
Notice that the rectangle is not completely inside of our canvas, and that's totally okay.

40
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:34,980
That is actually what is going on on the demonstration back over here.

41
00:02:35,190 --> 00:02:38,670
We can see that this rectangle is actually only halfway on the screen.

42
00:02:38,670 --> 00:02:43,020
And that's evident because that little red line right there, the red line is essentially at the center

43
00:02:43,020 --> 00:02:44,220
point of the rectangle.

44
00:02:44,550 --> 00:02:46,840
So the rectangle doesn't have to be all the way on the canvas.

45
00:02:46,860 --> 00:02:48,570
It can be half on, half off.

46
00:02:48,570 --> 00:02:52,530
And that's what we're going to do as well, just to make our code a little bit easier to understand.

47
00:02:53,420 --> 00:02:57,380
So we need to first provide the x y coordinate of the center of this rectangle.

48
00:02:57,380 --> 00:03:01,070
So the center will be approximately right there or so.

49
00:03:01,820 --> 00:03:08,420
So that's going to be 400 units over and it's going to be zero units down.

50
00:03:08,420 --> 00:03:10,430
So a Y of essentially zero.

51
00:03:11,610 --> 00:03:18,090
Then in total this thing is going to be 800 units wide and its height, well, the height doesn't really

52
00:03:18,090 --> 00:03:19,020
make a big difference.

53
00:03:19,020 --> 00:03:21,690
We just need to make sure that we have some kind of rectangle there.

54
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:26,430
We might use a height of like 40 or so, but really it's totally up to us.

55
00:03:26,430 --> 00:03:29,850
We can have any height whatsoever so long as it has a defined height.

56
00:03:29,850 --> 00:03:31,020
It just can't be zero.

57
00:03:32,070 --> 00:03:32,190
Okay.

58
00:03:32,370 --> 00:03:34,740
So let's now take those values.

59
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:36,940
Back over to our editor.

60
00:03:38,790 --> 00:03:39,810
So back over here.

61
00:03:39,810 --> 00:03:42,000
I'm going to do a 400.

62
00:03:42,270 --> 00:03:50,340
So that's 400 units over zero units down 800 units wide and 40 units tall.

63
00:03:50,970 --> 00:03:55,860
And then I'll put on the options object, which is static is true.

64
00:03:57,410 --> 00:04:01,340
And then after that, I'm going to make sure that I add this wals array to my world.

65
00:04:01,580 --> 00:04:07,970
So just a second ago we saw that we could call world add with lowercase world and then whatever our

66
00:04:07,970 --> 00:04:08,690
rectangle was.

67
00:04:08,690 --> 00:04:11,780
So like bodies, dot rectangle or whatever.

68
00:04:12,290 --> 00:04:17,810
So we can pass either a single shape in to the world add method, or alternatively we could pass in

69
00:04:17,810 --> 00:04:19,450
an array of shapes as well.

70
00:04:19,459 --> 00:04:21,870
And that's why I created this as a walls array.

71
00:04:21,890 --> 00:04:25,880
So I'm going to pass all these different walls that we're going to create in at once.

72
00:04:27,150 --> 00:04:28,180
So I'm going to save that.

73
00:04:30,490 --> 00:04:31,420
Go back over.

74
00:04:32,820 --> 00:04:33,630
Refresh.

75
00:04:34,420 --> 00:04:36,640
And now I can see the top wall on there.

76
00:04:36,850 --> 00:04:38,230
Okay, so that's a good start.

77
00:04:38,650 --> 00:04:42,490
So now we can repeat that same process for the three other walls as well.

78
00:04:43,370 --> 00:04:46,660
Only just very quickly draw out what the next two or three are going to be.

79
00:04:46,670 --> 00:04:51,890
So for the next one, let me just do a little bit of erasing here just to make sure things are nice

80
00:04:51,890 --> 00:04:56,570
and crystal clear, easy to read so we can do the bottom one next.

81
00:04:57,910 --> 00:04:59,650
So once again, this is going to be.

82
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:01,830
400 units over.

83
00:05:02,590 --> 00:05:03,910
It's going to be.

84
00:05:04,670 --> 00:05:10,790
Now 600 units down because remember, our overall canvas is a 100 by 600.

85
00:05:12,060 --> 00:05:16,380
It will be 800 wide and once again, we can use 40 tall.

86
00:05:18,170 --> 00:05:20,270
So I'm going to call.

87
00:05:22,340 --> 00:05:24,170
Body is not rectangle again.

88
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:28,590
We're going to be 400 units over this time.

89
00:05:28,590 --> 00:05:30,660
We're going to be 600 units down.

90
00:05:32,170 --> 00:05:35,410
We're going to be 800 units wide and 40 tall.

91
00:05:36,390 --> 00:05:37,470
Then is static.

92
00:05:38,340 --> 00:05:39,000
It's true.

93
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:43,760
So once again, save, refresh, and now I can see the bottom border.

94
00:05:44,390 --> 00:05:46,760
Kate, let's get through the last to here really quickly.

95
00:05:48,070 --> 00:05:49,210
So I think you get the idea now.

96
00:05:49,210 --> 00:05:54,160
But honestly, we're going to have to do all this dimensional stuff so often for this application that

97
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:57,940
it's kind of worth just putting in a little bit of time from the get go to make sure that these different

98
00:05:57,940 --> 00:05:59,140
values are really clear.

99
00:05:59,620 --> 00:06:01,510
So let's now do our left barrier.

100
00:06:01,510 --> 00:06:03,220
So this one will be slightly different.

101
00:06:03,610 --> 00:06:06,820
So again, we are 800 by 600 overall.

102
00:06:07,510 --> 00:06:09,100
So we're now going to go down.

103
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:11,230
300 units.

104
00:06:11,560 --> 00:06:13,960
We're going to go over zero.

105
00:06:14,970 --> 00:06:20,070
This thing is going to be 40 units wide now and 600 units tall.

106
00:06:20,940 --> 00:06:23,520
And then something very similar for the right hand side.

107
00:06:26,980 --> 00:06:27,970
We're going to be.

108
00:06:29,940 --> 00:06:30,990
Throwdown.

109
00:06:34,040 --> 00:06:36,590
You're going to be 800 over.

110
00:06:36,590 --> 00:06:38,240
So 800 to the right.

111
00:06:39,550 --> 00:06:41,380
We'll have 600 tall.

112
00:06:42,310 --> 00:06:44,110
And 40 wide.

113
00:06:45,490 --> 00:06:45,700
Yes.

114
00:06:45,700 --> 00:06:46,810
Let's do both of those.

115
00:06:48,770 --> 00:06:50,480
Ortiz Dots rectangle.

116
00:06:51,730 --> 00:06:53,520
So we'll do the left hand side first.

117
00:06:53,530 --> 00:06:57,850
So this one is going to be zero over 300 down.

118
00:06:59,710 --> 00:07:02,380
40 wide, 600 tall.

119
00:07:05,570 --> 00:07:07,340
And then finally the right hand side.

120
00:07:10,010 --> 00:07:12,200
So we'll do 800 over.

121
00:07:13,570 --> 00:07:14,530
300 down.

122
00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:18,640
40 wide, 600 tall.

123
00:07:20,690 --> 00:07:22,040
And I'll get the static.

124
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:23,030
True as well.

125
00:07:24,230 --> 00:07:24,500
Okay.

126
00:07:24,500 --> 00:07:25,190
So let's save that.

127
00:07:25,190 --> 00:07:26,420
Hopefully I didn't make any mistakes.

128
00:07:26,420 --> 00:07:30,980
If I did, we'll do a little bit of troubleshooting very quickly, but I'll refresh and okay, it actually

129
00:07:30,980 --> 00:07:31,850
all was correct.

130
00:07:31,850 --> 00:07:34,400
So I've got top, bottom, left and right.

131
00:07:34,910 --> 00:07:37,310
So now if we go back over once again.

132
00:07:37,990 --> 00:07:42,390
And I add in one last rectangle, like the same kind of plain rectangle that we had before.

133
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:46,480
And this time, rather than assigning it to a variable, I'll just add it into the world directly.

134
00:07:46,630 --> 00:07:51,490
So I'll do a world ad with the world bodies dot rectangle.

135
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:58,050
And this time I'll do 202 hundred 5050.

136
00:07:59,510 --> 00:08:03,620
Save this refresh, and now our rectangle falls down.

137
00:08:03,620 --> 00:08:06,050
But it hits that other one and it just stops right there.

138
00:08:06,750 --> 00:08:08,150
Okay, so that's definitely a good start.

139
00:08:08,420 --> 00:08:09,620
So let's take a pause right here.

140
00:08:09,630 --> 00:08:13,760
When we come back, the next video, we're going to throw in a ton of other shapes and we'll make sure

141
00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:15,720
that we can drag them all around with our mouse.

142
00:08:15,740 --> 00:08:17,990
So a quick pause and I'll see you in just a minute.
