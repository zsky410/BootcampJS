1
00:00:00,700 --> 00:00:01,030
All right.

2
00:00:01,030 --> 00:00:02,730
We've established how to update verticals.

3
00:00:02,740 --> 00:00:05,380
Now it's time to do the same thing for horizontals as well.

4
00:00:05,890 --> 00:00:08,590
So we're going to once again imagine that we're sitting right here in the middle.

5
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:12,120
And we're going to go only either up or down.

6
00:00:12,690 --> 00:00:15,930
So we want to update either that or that right there.

7
00:00:16,200 --> 00:00:18,720
So let's think about the structure of horizontals again.

8
00:00:21,780 --> 00:00:24,780
So remember, horizontals has some very different dimensions.

9
00:00:25,350 --> 00:00:31,050
It's going to be a 2D array, but it's going to have only two rows inside of it.

10
00:00:32,140 --> 00:00:40,750
And three columns because we are representing one, two, three and then row two is one, two, three.

11
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:43,090
So they all start off as false.

12
00:00:47,900 --> 00:00:51,290
So just to be really clear, that element right there corresponds with that.

13
00:00:51,290 --> 00:00:54,650
Well, that element corresponds with that wall and so on.

14
00:00:55,460 --> 00:01:00,710
So now if we think about moving up or down once again, we're going to establish that we've got a starting

15
00:01:00,710 --> 00:01:04,069
row of one and a column.

16
00:01:05,710 --> 00:01:06,460
Equal to one.

17
00:01:06,460 --> 00:01:09,310
And that represents the cell that we are currently in right here.

18
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:14,800
So we need to figure out how we can essentially take these values and depending on the direction, access

19
00:01:14,800 --> 00:01:18,220
and update either that element or that element.

20
00:01:20,360 --> 00:01:23,510
So once again, we can kind of ignore one of these variables.

21
00:01:23,510 --> 00:01:24,800
In this case, it's column.

22
00:01:24,800 --> 00:01:28,310
So whenever we move up or down, column is always going to stay the same.

23
00:01:29,020 --> 00:01:35,860
So we are going to update the element at column equal to whatever the current column is.

24
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:41,330
However, the row variable is going to change depending upon the direction we are going.

25
00:01:41,990 --> 00:01:43,880
So if we are going up.

26
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:49,890
Then Roe needs to be whatever the current ROE is, minus one.

27
00:01:51,140 --> 00:01:52,940
To get that one right there.

28
00:01:53,930 --> 00:01:55,310
And then if we are going down.

29
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:05,550
And Roe is going to be whatever the current ROE is to get this element right there, that wall, which

30
00:02:05,550 --> 00:02:06,780
is that right there.

31
00:02:07,080 --> 00:02:11,280
So in that case, it would be ROE, which is, in other words, one in our case.

32
00:02:13,160 --> 00:02:19,100
So to get from the central element up, it's going to essentially be either row minus one.

33
00:02:19,100 --> 00:02:22,370
And if we're going down, it's going to be whatever the current row is.

34
00:02:22,370 --> 00:02:24,650
And then column either way is going to stay the same.

35
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:25,950
Okay.

36
00:02:25,950 --> 00:02:30,420
So now we understand that let's go back over and write out these if cases as well as well.

37
00:02:30,420 --> 00:02:33,900
So I'll say else if direction is up.

38
00:02:35,230 --> 00:02:37,690
And we want to look at horizontals in this case.

39
00:02:38,230 --> 00:02:42,610
We want to look at row minus one and the same column.

40
00:02:43,270 --> 00:02:45,060
And we want to update that to true.

41
00:02:46,830 --> 00:02:48,270
And then else if.

42
00:02:49,390 --> 00:02:51,730
Direction is down.

43
00:02:52,780 --> 00:02:54,280
And we'll look at horizontals.

44
00:02:55,310 --> 00:02:59,540
I'm going to take whatever the current row is and the exact same column.

45
00:03:00,190 --> 00:03:01,330
And I'll set it to true.

46
00:03:02,020 --> 00:03:03,040
And that's pretty much it.

47
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:05,440
Okay.

48
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:09,610
So just like we did before, we're going to comment out a couple of the possible different directions

49
00:03:09,610 --> 00:03:13,270
and just do a quick test and make sure that everything is working correctly.

50
00:03:13,810 --> 00:03:18,280
So I'm going to comment outright and we'll first try up right here.

51
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:24,090
So again, if we are going to successfully go up, we want to update that element right there, which

52
00:03:24,090 --> 00:03:28,590
will be an index of Row Zero, column one.

53
00:03:30,940 --> 00:03:31,150
Yes.

54
00:03:31,150 --> 00:03:31,840
I'll save this.

55
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:35,920
I'm going to go back over to the browser, refresh, print out horizontals.

56
00:03:36,070 --> 00:03:39,730
Here's my two by three array and yep, I updated the correct value.

57
00:03:41,030 --> 00:03:43,970
So now we can test the same exact thing as well going down.

58
00:03:43,970 --> 00:03:47,120
So we'll comment out, up and uncomment down.

59
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:53,170
So if we correctly update down, we should be updating that one right there to true.

60
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:59,510
So I'll save refresh do a horizontals again.

61
00:04:00,700 --> 00:04:02,290
And right there we've updated to.

62
00:04:02,290 --> 00:04:02,860
True.

63
00:04:02,890 --> 00:04:03,670
Perfect.

64
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:04,540
Okay.

65
00:04:04,540 --> 00:04:05,420
So that's it.

66
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:10,180
I know this is probably been pretty nasty, but that is the hardest part of understanding this maze

67
00:04:10,180 --> 00:04:15,580
stuff is just understanding that depending upon the direction we are going, we have to adjust the indices

68
00:04:15,580 --> 00:04:18,279
of what we are, of what wall we are trying to update.

69
00:04:19,450 --> 00:04:19,720
All right.

70
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:23,860
So last thing I'm going to do here is essentially restore my code to a working state.

71
00:04:23,860 --> 00:04:26,650
So I'm going to uncomment all these different directions.

72
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:32,260
I'm going to make sure I get some commas back in there because my code formatter add on automatically

73
00:04:32,260 --> 00:04:32,950
removed them.

74
00:04:33,860 --> 00:04:37,880
I'll then go back down to my step through cell call right here.

75
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:43,350
And I'll throw in my start row and my start column.

76
00:04:44,820 --> 00:04:45,090
Okay.

77
00:04:45,090 --> 00:04:47,840
So last thing we have to do is visit that next cell.

78
00:04:47,850 --> 00:04:49,890
So we'll take care of that in the next video.
