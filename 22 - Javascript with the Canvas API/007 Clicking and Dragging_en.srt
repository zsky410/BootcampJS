1
00:00:00,990 --> 00:00:05,160
Now that we have these borders around the edge of the screen, I want to try to enable click and drag

2
00:00:05,160 --> 00:00:08,010
functionality on this single little square right there.

3
00:00:08,220 --> 00:00:12,600
So more or less the same behavior that we see over here when we click and drag on a shape.

4
00:00:13,610 --> 00:00:17,750
Adding in this click and drag functionality is really surprisingly easy to do.

5
00:00:18,020 --> 00:00:21,890
This is something that matter DJs wanted to make, really easy to add to any project.

6
00:00:21,890 --> 00:00:26,060
So it's just a couple of lines of code to add in the ability to click and drag something to move it

7
00:00:26,060 --> 00:00:26,690
around.

8
00:00:27,230 --> 00:00:29,630
To get started, I'll find my index file.

9
00:00:29,840 --> 00:00:31,670
I'll go up to the top and find where we are.

10
00:00:31,670 --> 00:00:34,520
Pulling off some different properties from the matter library.

11
00:00:35,030 --> 00:00:39,530
I'm going to pull off another property called Mouse Constraint.

12
00:00:40,940 --> 00:00:45,590
So we're going to use this object right here to set up something called, you guessed it, a mouse constraint.

13
00:00:45,620 --> 00:00:50,360
This essentially means that we're going to set up something to respond directly to mouse input.

14
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:57,410
I'm going to go down right after our runners run line and I'm going to create the constraint and then

15
00:00:57,410 --> 00:00:58,760
add it to our world.

16
00:00:59,420 --> 00:01:03,050
So I will say world ad world.

17
00:01:04,010 --> 00:01:09,290
And I'm going to pass in as the second argument mouse constraint create.

18
00:01:10,280 --> 00:01:13,040
As the first argument to that I'll pass in my engine.

19
00:01:14,180 --> 00:01:19,670
And then as the second argument, I'll pass in an options object that's going to have a mouse property.

20
00:01:20,270 --> 00:01:25,250
And for that I'll say mouse create render dot canvas.

21
00:01:26,050 --> 00:01:30,330
And I think I missed one other thing that we have to require into this file or de structure off of matter.

22
00:01:30,340 --> 00:01:32,320
We need to make sure we grab mouse as well.

23
00:01:32,350 --> 00:01:36,850
So I'm going to go back up here and just make sure that I pull in the mouse object as well.

24
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:39,000
Okay.

25
00:01:39,050 --> 00:01:41,210
So believe it or not, that is pretty much it right there.

26
00:01:41,210 --> 00:01:42,410
So I'm going to save this.

27
00:01:43,710 --> 00:01:49,410
I'm going to go back over and now if I refresh, I can click and drag on that object and throw it around

28
00:01:49,410 --> 00:01:50,040
the screen.

29
00:01:50,370 --> 00:01:54,300
You'll notice that when I click and drag, I get that kind of green line that's supposed to represent

30
00:01:54,300 --> 00:01:58,560
a spring or essentially a force that we are trying to apply to this little square.

31
00:01:59,510 --> 00:02:03,620
So now all we have to do is start to add in a bunch of other shapes to this thing, and we'll have something

32
00:02:03,620 --> 00:02:05,900
very much like the demo that we saw back over here.

33
00:02:06,530 --> 00:02:10,639
So another quick pause and let's try to add in a bunch more shapes in the next video.
