1
00:00:00,550 --> 00:00:02,480
Well, we now understand the basics of matter.

2
00:00:02,950 --> 00:00:06,400
So now we can start to think about how we're going to build this actual maze.

3
00:00:06,460 --> 00:00:10,540
In this video, I'm going to give you an overview of the algorithm that we're going to use to generate

4
00:00:10,540 --> 00:00:13,210
the maze itself, and we'll start to write out the code for it.

5
00:00:13,210 --> 00:00:15,610
So let's talk about how we're going to generate the maze.

6
00:00:16,860 --> 00:00:19,360
So we're going to go through the algorithm that you see right here.

7
00:00:19,380 --> 00:00:23,190
I'm going to first give you a verbal description and then we'll take a look at a series of diagrams

8
00:00:23,190 --> 00:00:26,220
to help you understand how this actually builds a maze out.

9
00:00:26,820 --> 00:00:30,090
So the first thing we're going to do is create a grid of cells.

10
00:00:30,180 --> 00:00:34,710
A cell essentially represents each space that a user can visit.

11
00:00:34,980 --> 00:00:40,110
If we go back to the original diagram over here, right here, this kind of rectangular space like right

12
00:00:40,110 --> 00:00:41,730
there, that is one cell.

13
00:00:41,970 --> 00:00:44,210
And then right next to it, we've got another cell.

14
00:00:44,220 --> 00:00:48,450
And then right underneath that, another cell, another cell and so on.

15
00:00:49,080 --> 00:00:55,140
So we're going to build out a 2D array or a two dimensional array to represent this grid of cells.

16
00:00:55,830 --> 00:00:58,860
We're then going to pick a random starting cell inside their.

17
00:00:59,530 --> 00:01:05,290
And then starting at that cell, we're going to build a randomly ordered list of all of its neighbors

18
00:01:05,800 --> 00:01:07,330
for each neighbor that we find.

19
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:11,290
We're going to say that if we've already kind of visited that cell, so to speak, and we'll discuss

20
00:01:11,290 --> 00:01:15,880
what it exactly means to visit a cell in just a moment, we're going to remove it from the randomly

21
00:01:15,880 --> 00:01:16,750
ordered list.

22
00:01:18,480 --> 00:01:23,040
Then for each remaining neighbor, we're going to move to that neighbor and we're going to remove the

23
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:28,440
wall between those two cells, and then we're going to repeat that process for that new neighbor.

24
00:01:28,740 --> 00:01:32,730
So we're going to go back there and repeat this process over and over and over again.

25
00:01:33,530 --> 00:01:38,090
Now, I really don't expect you to understand this algorithm just from these kind of text steps right

26
00:01:38,090 --> 00:01:38,560
here.

27
00:01:38,570 --> 00:01:42,950
So instead, let me show you a quick diagram to help you really understand what's going on here.

28
00:01:44,050 --> 00:01:44,240
Okay.

29
00:01:44,350 --> 00:01:46,510
So this represents a starting grid.

30
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:50,980
This is going to be a 2D array that we're going to build out of some JavaScript code.

31
00:01:51,310 --> 00:01:54,370
So we're going to pick a random starting cell inside of here.

32
00:01:54,700 --> 00:01:58,410
We're then going to iterate it using the same steps that I just spoke about right here.

33
00:01:58,430 --> 00:02:03,550
We're going to see how it eventually is going to build us a randomized phase.

34
00:02:04,690 --> 00:02:06,610
So let me get a different color really quickly.

35
00:02:08,289 --> 00:02:11,950
So out of our grid right here, we're going to first start off with a random cell.

36
00:02:12,070 --> 00:02:15,730
So in this case, I'm going to start off with a random cell of that one right there.

37
00:02:16,180 --> 00:02:19,210
We're then going to take a look at all of the cells, different neighbors.

38
00:02:19,480 --> 00:02:24,460
So in this case, I'm going to look above to the left, to the right and below.

39
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:30,310
So the four possible neighbors I have are one, two, three and four.

40
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:35,120
So I'm then going to pick one of these neighbors at random to visit.

41
00:02:35,140 --> 00:02:37,660
So maybe in this case, I decide to go down.

42
00:02:37,900 --> 00:02:41,530
So I would go down to this cell right here.

43
00:02:42,230 --> 00:02:46,250
When I go down there, I'm going to remove the wall between those two cells.

44
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:48,720
So I would delete.

45
00:02:49,960 --> 00:02:52,300
This wall right here.

46
00:02:54,150 --> 00:02:58,170
Then at this new cell, I would now take a look at all of this one's new neighbors.

47
00:02:58,440 --> 00:03:03,510
So there's a neighbor above, a neighbor to the left, below and to the right.

48
00:03:04,140 --> 00:03:09,480
Now, in this case, I have already been to or kind of visited or processed the neighbor above.

49
00:03:09,690 --> 00:03:15,090
So in this case, I would drop the neighbor above from my list of possible cells that I could visit.

50
00:03:16,230 --> 00:03:19,080
So then maybe in this case I would decide to go to the left.

51
00:03:19,650 --> 00:03:21,390
So I'm going to visit to the left.

52
00:03:21,420 --> 00:03:22,680
Go over here.

53
00:03:23,820 --> 00:03:28,020
And then just like before, I'll delete the wall right there.

54
00:03:29,290 --> 00:03:32,220
Now this process is essentially just going to repeat itself over and over again.

55
00:03:32,220 --> 00:03:34,950
So right here, I've got three possible moves.

56
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:37,360
In this case, I'll decide to go up.

57
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:39,010
And again, this is totally random.

58
00:03:40,020 --> 00:03:41,610
So we'll go up to right there.

59
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:43,710
I will remove the wall in between.

60
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:51,830
I've now only got two possible moves, so either up or to the left, because I've already been below

61
00:03:51,830 --> 00:03:52,760
and to the right.

62
00:03:52,910 --> 00:03:55,520
So now maybe I go, How about.

63
00:03:56,750 --> 00:03:57,650
To the left.

64
00:03:58,500 --> 00:04:03,660
Now I can go up or down and only a couple more steps here, because there's one kind of corner case

65
00:04:03,660 --> 00:04:05,670
I want to point out to you here really quickly.

66
00:04:06,510 --> 00:04:08,100
Now, maybe I would decide to go up.

67
00:04:09,870 --> 00:04:10,130
Now.

68
00:04:10,140 --> 00:04:11,250
I'd go up here.

69
00:04:12,380 --> 00:04:14,240
I've only got one possible direction now.

70
00:04:15,230 --> 00:04:19,459
So I'm going to imagine that I come over and then maybe I come over again.

71
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:23,990
I come over again and now I've got a random decision to make.

72
00:04:23,990 --> 00:04:27,380
Once again, I can either go to the right over here or below right there.

73
00:04:27,530 --> 00:04:34,580
So I'm going to imagine that maybe randomly I go down and then randomly I go down one more, randomly

74
00:04:34,580 --> 00:04:34,910
down.

75
00:04:34,910 --> 00:04:39,740
I know kind of crazy odds to go down that many times in a row, but let's just imagine for a second.

76
00:04:39,740 --> 00:04:42,920
And now here's where we start to get to a really interesting situation.

77
00:04:43,250 --> 00:04:45,080
Let's imagine that I come over here.

78
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:48,780
And end up right here.

79
00:04:48,810 --> 00:04:54,120
So now in this scenario, as I am right here, I don't have any additional way to move, but there are

80
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:58,320
still unvisited squares all the way over here on the right hand side that I still need to visit.

81
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:04,400
So if I ever get to a point where I have no possible moves whatsoever, then I would essentially backtrack.

82
00:05:04,410 --> 00:05:10,230
So I would go back until I find a cell that does have a valid neighbor to move to.

83
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:15,210
So the first one, as I backtrack that would have a valid move, would be this one right here.

84
00:05:16,180 --> 00:05:20,980
So I would backtrack from here all the way to the cell right here.

85
00:05:21,100 --> 00:05:24,910
And then back at this cell, I would once again say, what are my valid neighbors?

86
00:05:25,210 --> 00:05:27,610
In this case, I can only possibly go to the right.

87
00:05:27,610 --> 00:05:32,710
So I would move over that way and then repeat the process for all the rest of those squares.

88
00:05:33,070 --> 00:05:36,400
Now, as I drew out some of these steps here rather quickly, I didn't remove the walls.

89
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:39,850
But just to be clear, I still would be removing the walls all along the way.

90
00:05:40,330 --> 00:05:41,630
So I would drop that one.

91
00:05:41,650 --> 00:05:43,780
That one right there.

92
00:05:44,530 --> 00:05:45,220
Right there.

93
00:05:45,220 --> 00:05:46,000
Right there.

94
00:05:47,070 --> 00:05:48,840
And so on.

95
00:05:49,020 --> 00:05:50,040
All the way through.

96
00:05:50,700 --> 00:05:53,250
Now, this drawing is getting a little bit messy here.

97
00:05:55,430 --> 00:05:56,940
And one other right there.

98
00:05:56,960 --> 00:05:59,870
It's getting a little bit messy here, so I'm going to delete some of the red lines.

99
00:06:00,330 --> 00:06:04,850
And if I do, so you're going to start to see how I actually do end up getting a real maze shape here.

100
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:08,300
It's going to delete all those lines I drew on.

101
00:06:12,060 --> 00:06:14,470
And you can really start to see the maze start to form out.

102
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:18,130
So if I imagine I kept on going through this, maybe I went from.

103
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:24,280
This one here to the right and then up and then like something like this.

104
00:06:24,290 --> 00:06:29,990
And if I trace that out and removed all the appropriate walls, I really would start to see the entire

105
00:06:29,990 --> 00:06:31,340
maze start to form.

106
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:35,970
So drop the walls.

107
00:06:38,170 --> 00:06:39,730
For each one that I cross over.

108
00:06:41,580 --> 00:06:42,720
And there we go.

109
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:44,070
There's my entire maze.

110
00:06:44,730 --> 00:06:46,020
So that's the general idea.

111
00:06:46,110 --> 00:06:48,190
Again, we're going to build out the grid.

112
00:06:48,210 --> 00:06:49,570
We're going to pick a random cell.

113
00:06:49,590 --> 00:06:50,490
Look at the neighbors.

114
00:06:50,490 --> 00:06:52,470
Walk to each neighbor as soon as we do.

115
00:06:52,500 --> 00:06:53,740
We're going to drop the wall.

116
00:06:53,760 --> 00:06:57,390
If we ever get to a point where there are no valid moves, as we saw right there.

117
00:06:57,420 --> 00:07:02,910
We're going to backtrack until we find a cell that there is a valid move act and we'll repeat the process

118
00:07:02,910 --> 00:07:03,900
from that cell.

119
00:07:04,590 --> 00:07:06,640
So this is how we're going to generate the maize.

120
00:07:06,660 --> 00:07:12,420
It's going to make sure that we always end up with one valid path to every single square inside of our

121
00:07:12,420 --> 00:07:12,930
grid.

122
00:07:13,170 --> 00:07:17,610
So this is going to guarantee that if I have a starting position up here, as we said, that our app

123
00:07:17,610 --> 00:07:22,620
was and I want to get to the ending position down here at the bottom right hand side, there will always

124
00:07:22,650 --> 00:07:24,270
be a valid route to get there.

125
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:26,100
So that's the idea.

126
00:07:26,100 --> 00:07:27,550
That's how we're going to implement this.

127
00:07:27,570 --> 00:07:30,780
As you can imagine, some of the code for it is going to be a little bit challenging.

128
00:07:30,780 --> 00:07:35,610
But at the end of the day, as long as you remember back to this example right here, it will eventually

129
00:07:35,610 --> 00:07:36,510
make some sense.

130
00:07:37,050 --> 00:07:41,310
One thing that I highly recommend that you do as we start to write out all this code, is get out a

131
00:07:41,310 --> 00:07:44,160
sheet of paper and try to sketch out a grid like this one right here.

132
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:47,970
I'm going to continue to do a lot of drawings to help you understand every step along the way.

133
00:07:47,970 --> 00:07:52,590
But it's really no substitute for you getting out a piece of paper on your own and kind of drawing out

134
00:07:52,590 --> 00:07:54,900
or diagramming the maze creation process.

135
00:07:56,440 --> 00:08:01,240
So now that we understand the general idea or the general strategy, let's take a pause right here and

136
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:03,550
talk some more specifics in the next video.
