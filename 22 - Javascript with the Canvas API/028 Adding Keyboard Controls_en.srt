1
00:00:00,750 --> 00:00:04,680
Plus we have to do inside of our event listener is make sure that whenever a user presses on the appropriate

2
00:00:04,680 --> 00:00:07,260
key, we change the movement of the ball.

3
00:00:07,410 --> 00:00:08,910
So how are we going to do that?

4
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:13,440
Well, essentially what we're going to do is take a look at the current velocity of the ball.

5
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:17,700
When I use the word velocity, that means the speed in which the ball is moving.

6
00:00:18,450 --> 00:00:23,100
So we're going to take the velocity of the ball and then we're going to update it or add in some additional

7
00:00:23,100 --> 00:00:27,570
velocity in the up, down, left or right directions.

8
00:00:28,370 --> 00:00:32,210
To change the velocity of a shape, we have to get another object from the matter.

9
00:00:32,210 --> 00:00:33,230
GS Library.

10
00:00:33,380 --> 00:00:37,580
So I'm going to go up to the very top of the file where we are currently structuring a couple of properties.

11
00:00:38,090 --> 00:00:42,140
We're going to de structure another property called body like so.

12
00:00:43,570 --> 00:00:48,310
His body object has some different functions on it that allow us to update the different properties

13
00:00:48,310 --> 00:00:53,950
inside of a shape so he can use it to change the dimensions of a shape, its position velocity, its

14
00:00:53,950 --> 00:00:55,600
rotation and so on.

15
00:00:56,470 --> 00:01:00,660
So now that we've got that body object, let's go back down to our event handler.

16
00:01:01,590 --> 00:01:02,370
Down here.

17
00:01:02,370 --> 00:01:06,600
We're going to first take a look at our ball and get its current velocity.

18
00:01:07,020 --> 00:01:13,500
So I'm going to say concept X and Y with some curly braces because we are doing some de structuring

19
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:14,040
here.

20
00:01:14,190 --> 00:01:16,380
Ball dot velocity.

21
00:01:17,030 --> 00:01:20,540
So X and Y are going to be the current velocity of the ball.

22
00:01:21,020 --> 00:01:25,070
Let's do a quick console log and just see what those values are printed out as.

23
00:01:26,550 --> 00:01:31,260
Now we'll go back over refresh and refresh once again.

24
00:01:31,260 --> 00:01:36,330
And right after I refresh, I'm going to press on the W key, which should trigger that code to go essentially.

25
00:01:37,370 --> 00:01:42,680
Right here, like go or print out the console log so I can refresh and then press a couple of times

26
00:01:42,680 --> 00:01:45,860
and we can see the console log of the x and y values.

27
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:52,210
So we'll see the very first console.log right here as the ball was falling down, we had an x coordinate

28
00:01:52,210 --> 00:01:56,470
or an X velocity of zero, which means that the ball was not moving side to side at all.

29
00:01:57,270 --> 00:02:03,510
But the Y value was 8.23, which means the ball was going downwards or it was moving downwards.

30
00:02:04,630 --> 00:02:09,340
Over time, once the ball kind of hit that block right there and started rolling slightly, we can see

31
00:02:09,340 --> 00:02:11,920
that these numbers got very, very small until now.

32
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:15,670
If I press again, they're at zero zero because the ball is not moving at all.

33
00:02:17,490 --> 00:02:17,760
Okay.

34
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:23,790
So now that we've got these values, we can use those and add in some additional velocity to either

35
00:02:23,790 --> 00:02:25,410
the X or Y coordinate.

36
00:02:26,340 --> 00:02:28,680
So I'm going to take care of moving the ball up first.

37
00:02:28,860 --> 00:02:32,690
I'll remove the console log and I'll say body set velocity.

38
00:02:32,700 --> 00:02:35,010
This is how we update the velocity of a shape.

39
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:36,660
We'll say ball.

40
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:42,090
And then I'm going to get the same X that we have right now.

41
00:02:42,090 --> 00:02:47,370
So I'll say X is x and remember we can use that key value shortcut when those variables are identical.

42
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:49,140
To reduce it down to just x.

43
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:55,760
And then my why is going to be whatever the Y currently is minus five.

44
00:02:56,910 --> 00:03:01,500
We are subtracting five year because we want to move the ball in the other direction and to move it

45
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:04,230
up, we want to have a negative velocity.

46
00:03:04,650 --> 00:03:09,510
So every single time that the user presses on the W key, which is key code 87, we're going to take

47
00:03:09,510 --> 00:03:15,300
whatever the current velocity is, we're going to subtract five to it and set the velocity to that new

48
00:03:15,300 --> 00:03:16,350
Y velocity.

49
00:03:17,450 --> 00:03:19,520
So let's now save this and do a quick test.

50
00:03:20,150 --> 00:03:21,050
I'll flip back over.

51
00:03:21,050 --> 00:03:21,760
Refresh.

52
00:03:21,770 --> 00:03:25,370
I'm going to refresh a couple of times until I get a nice column like this right here, like lots of

53
00:03:25,370 --> 00:03:26,360
space to work with.

54
00:03:26,690 --> 00:03:29,840
I'll press w a couple of times, and every single time I do.

55
00:03:29,870 --> 00:03:35,030
The ball moves slightly faster and faster because every single time I press it, I'm accelerating five

56
00:03:35,030 --> 00:03:39,620
additional or adding five units of velocity in the upwards direction.

57
00:03:40,730 --> 00:03:40,890
Okay.

58
00:03:41,030 --> 00:03:41,840
So that looks good.

59
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:46,440
So let's now repeat the same process for each of our different directions.

60
00:03:46,860 --> 00:03:52,200
So I'm going to copy that set velocity and we'll take care of going right next.

61
00:03:52,530 --> 00:03:55,800
So in this case, I'm going to clear out the X and Y inside of here.

62
00:03:56,750 --> 00:04:02,630
If I want to move right, I'm going to do X of whatever the current x velocity is plus five.

63
00:04:03,260 --> 00:04:03,830
And the same.

64
00:04:03,830 --> 00:04:04,400
Why?

65
00:04:05,710 --> 00:04:07,150
And I'll delete that console log.

66
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:10,270
Then to go down, I'll delete the council log.

67
00:04:10,750 --> 00:04:16,120
In this case, I still want to adjust the Y value, but to go downwards faster, I want to do a plus

68
00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:16,690
five.

69
00:04:18,060 --> 00:04:20,070
And then to move to the left faster.

70
00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:22,590
I'm going to do.

71
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:26,220
Same.

72
00:04:26,220 --> 00:04:26,880
Why?

73
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:30,610
And an X of X minus five.

74
00:04:30,630 --> 00:04:33,690
So again, to move to the left, we subtract from x.

75
00:04:34,850 --> 00:04:36,170
All right, so I'll save this.

76
00:04:36,620 --> 00:04:38,090
I'm going to flip back over once again.

77
00:04:38,090 --> 00:04:41,630
And now we should have full control of the ball so I can go to the right.

78
00:04:41,630 --> 00:04:42,410
Left?

79
00:04:42,680 --> 00:04:43,730
I can go up.

80
00:04:43,730 --> 00:04:45,170
And I can go down as well.

81
00:04:46,100 --> 00:04:47,300
And that's pretty much it.

82
00:04:47,660 --> 00:04:51,050
Now, if this thing feels laggy right now, that's totally fine.

83
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:55,550
You can always try to close your developer console, and when you do so, you're going to see that the

84
00:04:55,550 --> 00:04:59,030
map or the maze is slightly more responsive and just a little bit less laggy.

85
00:04:59,060 --> 00:05:04,280
It's not a total solution, but definitely having your developer console open adds in a little bit more

86
00:05:04,280 --> 00:05:05,570
of a performance penalty.

87
00:05:06,110 --> 00:05:08,360
Now we can easily start to navigate through our maze.

88
00:05:09,790 --> 00:05:09,970
Okay.

89
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,440
So this is looking pretty good.

90
00:05:11,710 --> 00:05:15,760
But I think that having the gravity turned on is a little bit distracting.

91
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:17,590
So let's take a quick pause right here.

92
00:05:17,590 --> 00:05:21,580
When we come back to the next video, we're going to disable gravity inside of our maze, which is going

93
00:05:21,580 --> 00:05:24,430
to make controlling that ball just a little bit more easy.

94
00:05:24,790 --> 00:05:27,040
So a quick pause and I'll see you in just a minute.
