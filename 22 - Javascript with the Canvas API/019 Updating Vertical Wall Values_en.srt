1
00:00:00,640 --> 00:00:05,140
Last thing we have to do is to make sure that we remove the wall whenever we are traveling up or down,

2
00:00:05,140 --> 00:00:06,220
left or right.

3
00:00:06,520 --> 00:00:11,560
So I want to first get a quick reminder by taking a look at a diagram at how we're going to update horizontals

4
00:00:11,560 --> 00:00:12,700
and verticals.

5
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:17,230
Before I show you the diagram, however, or before we walk through it, I just want to remind you that

6
00:00:17,230 --> 00:00:20,380
inside this function, we have access to a couple of different variables.

7
00:00:20,710 --> 00:00:22,750
First, we have access to the row and column.

8
00:00:22,750 --> 00:00:25,390
That is the current row and column that we're working on.

9
00:00:25,630 --> 00:00:30,160
We also have access to the next row and next column, and that's where we are traveling to.

10
00:00:30,460 --> 00:00:35,260
So just keep specifically the row and column variables in your head for right now, because we're going

11
00:00:35,260 --> 00:00:38,620
to use those quite heavily in this last block of code that we write right here.

12
00:00:39,240 --> 00:00:40,480
Okay, so let's get to it.

13
00:00:40,510 --> 00:00:45,460
So what I want to focus on is how we're going to update the horizontals and the verticals array.

14
00:00:45,490 --> 00:00:48,430
We're going to first consider how we're going to update horizontals.

15
00:00:48,910 --> 00:00:54,790
So we're going to imagine that we're at this center cell right here, which means that our initial row

16
00:00:54,790 --> 00:00:55,690
is one.

17
00:00:56,510 --> 00:00:59,450
And our initial column is one as well.

18
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:05,099
And then we're going to imagine that we move only left or right.

19
00:01:05,099 --> 00:01:07,200
So only thinking about verticals right now.

20
00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:13,770
As a reminder, verticals are that that all these walls that I'm circling right now.

21
00:01:14,840 --> 00:01:16,190
So verticals in general.

22
00:01:18,780 --> 00:01:21,570
Is always going to be, remember, a two dimensional array.

23
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:24,230
It's always going to have three rows.

24
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:27,750
So row one, two and three.

25
00:01:28,510 --> 00:01:29,620
So here's row one.

26
00:01:29,620 --> 00:01:30,520
Row two.

27
00:01:31,380 --> 00:01:32,760
And three.

28
00:01:33,180 --> 00:01:36,120
And then they all start off as false inside their.

29
00:01:39,310 --> 00:01:43,430
So this false right here corresponds to that element right there.

30
00:01:43,450 --> 00:01:46,780
This false corresponds to that right there and so on.

31
00:01:47,080 --> 00:01:51,730
So what we really want to determine when we are deciding to go either left or right, right here from

32
00:01:51,730 --> 00:01:56,430
the center element is whether we are flipping that to true or that to true.

33
00:01:56,440 --> 00:01:57,910
That is the big question here.

34
00:01:57,910 --> 00:02:03,910
And we need to decide which of these to flip based upon the direction we are traveling and our current

35
00:02:03,910 --> 00:02:05,080
row and column.

36
00:02:05,500 --> 00:02:10,690
So let's figure out how to take the current row and column and the direction and translate it into some

37
00:02:10,690 --> 00:02:15,580
index that we can use to access the vertical array and update the appropriate element.

38
00:02:16,830 --> 00:02:17,160
Okay.

39
00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:22,410
So the actual row that we're going to update, that's actually pretty easy.

40
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:25,350
The row that we're going to update inside the verticals array.

41
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:29,690
We put Roe right here.

42
00:02:30,390 --> 00:02:35,610
It's always going to be whatever the current row is that we're looking at because we're always staying

43
00:02:35,610 --> 00:02:36,630
inside of the same row.

44
00:02:36,630 --> 00:02:40,470
So row is never going to change when we update verticals or whenever we move left or right.

45
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:43,230
However, the same is not true of column.

46
00:02:43,590 --> 00:02:49,380
So whenever we decide to move left or right, the column index that we want to update is going to be

47
00:02:49,380 --> 00:02:52,320
either zero or one.

48
00:02:52,320 --> 00:02:54,780
So either that element or that element.

49
00:02:55,690 --> 00:02:57,400
If we are moving to the left.

50
00:02:58,160 --> 00:03:01,880
And we want to update the element at column zero.

51
00:03:01,910 --> 00:03:03,590
That would be that one right there.

52
00:03:03,590 --> 00:03:08,120
So that's if we were going that way, we want to dump this element right here.

53
00:03:08,750 --> 00:03:15,110
So that means we need to access the verticals array at column zero and update what is ever right there

54
00:03:15,110 --> 00:03:15,920
to a true.

55
00:03:17,020 --> 00:03:21,940
On the other hand, if we are moving to the right, then we want to update this thing right here and

56
00:03:21,940 --> 00:03:23,310
flip it from true to false.

57
00:03:23,320 --> 00:03:25,510
So that would be this element right here.

58
00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:27,460
So if we are going to the right.

59
00:03:29,790 --> 00:03:36,450
That means that we want to return an index of one because we want to get index of one and update this

60
00:03:36,450 --> 00:03:36,930
guy.

61
00:03:38,490 --> 00:03:42,510
So it's pretty clear here that when we are moving left or right, the row is always going to stay the

62
00:03:42,510 --> 00:03:42,900
same.

63
00:03:42,900 --> 00:03:49,050
But depending upon whether we are going left or right, we need to either assess verticals at zero or

64
00:03:49,050 --> 00:03:49,560
one.

65
00:03:49,590 --> 00:03:51,270
That's all I'm trying to establish here.

66
00:03:51,780 --> 00:03:55,440
So now that we understand that, let's go back over to our editor and start to write out this logic.

67
00:03:56,570 --> 00:03:56,760
Okay.

68
00:03:56,780 --> 00:03:58,940
So I've got my statement right here.

69
00:03:58,940 --> 00:04:02,990
We want to remove a wall from either horizontals or verticals, so we're going to first think about

70
00:04:02,990 --> 00:04:04,430
moving left or right.

71
00:04:04,610 --> 00:04:07,010
So let's say if direction.

72
00:04:07,010 --> 00:04:11,300
Remember, we've got the direction variable that we stuffed into the neighbors array.

73
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:16,140
If that is left, then I want to access verticals.

74
00:04:17,140 --> 00:04:21,399
At the exact same row that we were working on, because, remember, the road doesn't change at all.

75
00:04:21,399 --> 00:04:23,050
It's only the column that changes.

76
00:04:23,500 --> 00:04:27,460
So if we're going to the left, we're going to look at columns minus one.

77
00:04:29,100 --> 00:04:32,130
And it's minus one, because remember, we start off with a column of one.

78
00:04:32,130 --> 00:04:33,810
That's the column that we're at right now.

79
00:04:35,170 --> 00:04:37,840
So we're going to take one off to get zero.

80
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:44,300
And then if we are, we're going to set that to true, which means there is an opening here so we can

81
00:04:44,300 --> 00:04:45,860
handle the else if case.

82
00:04:46,950 --> 00:04:49,260
Otherwise if direction is right.

83
00:04:50,010 --> 00:04:56,940
And we want to look at verticals again still on the same row, but in this case at the same exact column,

84
00:04:57,510 --> 00:04:59,040
we're going to update that to true.

85
00:04:59,430 --> 00:05:00,660
And I apologize.

86
00:05:00,660 --> 00:05:06,780
I typed in a columns right here that should be column singular like so column in both cases.

87
00:05:07,830 --> 00:05:08,750
And that's pretty much it.

88
00:05:08,760 --> 00:05:13,050
So in both cases we've got the same exact row we're updating, but if we're going left, we're going

89
00:05:13,050 --> 00:05:15,410
to update at column minus one.

90
00:05:15,420 --> 00:05:18,960
Otherwise, if we're going right, we're going to update at the current column to true.

91
00:05:20,070 --> 00:05:20,430
All right.

92
00:05:20,430 --> 00:05:23,380
So now it would really be nice to test this out.

93
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:24,720
So to test this out.

94
00:05:25,880 --> 00:05:28,820
I'm going to go back up to where we establish all of our neighbors.

95
00:05:29,510 --> 00:05:32,630
And I'm going to comment out the first three cases.

96
00:05:32,630 --> 00:05:36,110
So I'm going to say the only possibility here is that we can travel left.

97
00:05:36,860 --> 00:05:38,330
And then going to go back down.

98
00:05:38,990 --> 00:05:40,280
And make sure that I'm still calling.

99
00:05:40,280 --> 00:05:43,460
Step three sell with a fixed value of one and one.

100
00:05:44,380 --> 00:05:45,220
And I'll save this.

101
00:05:45,250 --> 00:05:47,050
Go back over to the browser refresh.

102
00:05:47,530 --> 00:05:53,590
I'm going to print out the verticals variable and now I can see that I have correctly updated that element

103
00:05:53,590 --> 00:05:55,690
like this one right here.

104
00:05:55,720 --> 00:05:56,980
That one got updated to.

105
00:05:56,980 --> 00:05:57,550
True.

106
00:05:58,160 --> 00:05:59,320
So that definitely worked out correctly.

107
00:05:59,320 --> 00:06:01,180
And that was for a move to the left.

108
00:06:01,660 --> 00:06:05,980
So now we can repeat that same process, but I'll comment out everything but a movement to the right.

109
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:09,160
So now I'm going to only be able to move to the right.

110
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:10,870
So I'll save this refresh.

111
00:06:12,070 --> 00:06:13,210
Burnt out verticals.

112
00:06:14,630 --> 00:06:19,970
And now I see right there awesome updated to true because I was moving to the right and once again that's

113
00:06:19,970 --> 00:06:25,700
because we wanted to update that one right there to true to represent an opening in that wall right

114
00:06:25,700 --> 00:06:26,210
there.

115
00:06:27,430 --> 00:06:27,740
Okay.

116
00:06:27,760 --> 00:06:30,340
So I think that we've got our verticals put together.

117
00:06:30,340 --> 00:06:31,710
So let's take a quick pause right here.

118
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:35,750
We're then going to repeat the same exact process, but with our horizontals instead.

119
00:06:35,770 --> 00:06:37,960
So quick, follow us and I'll see you in just a minute.
