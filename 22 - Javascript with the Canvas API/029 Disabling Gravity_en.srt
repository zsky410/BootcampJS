00:00:00,890 --> 00:00:04,820
In this video, we're going to make sure that we disable gravity inside of our maze again.

2
00:00:04,820 --> 00:00:07,790
That's going to make this ball just a little bit easier to control.

3
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:11,330
So to disable gravity, I'll go back over to my editor.

4
00:00:11,720 --> 00:00:16,190
I'm going to go up to the very top and I'm going to find where we create the engine right here.

5
00:00:17,010 --> 00:00:21,780
So in order to disable gravity, we're going to change a property on that engine variable.

6
00:00:22,050 --> 00:00:29,610
We'll say engine dot, world dot, gravity dot y equals zero like so.

7
00:00:30,490 --> 00:00:33,850
So that's going to disable gravity in the Y direction entirely.

8
00:00:34,820 --> 00:00:39,290
So now if we go back over and refresh the ball is just going to stay where it is until we start to apply

9
00:00:39,290 --> 00:00:45,680
some velocity to it so I can tap on the button and now I go to left, right, up, down.

10
00:00:46,070 --> 00:00:48,680
And now it's a little bit easier to control than it was before.

11
00:00:49,010 --> 00:00:52,970
It's still kind of challenging to control because the ball starts to move like really quickly, but

12
00:00:52,970 --> 00:00:54,540
we'll start to address that over time.

13
00:00:54,560 --> 00:00:58,220
Eventually, you're going to realize that having the ball kind of responsive is actually kind of nice

14
00:00:58,220 --> 00:01:03,260
when we have a really large maze and it takes up essentially the full width and height of our screen.

15
00:01:03,560 --> 00:01:08,360
So eventually we can add in some tweaks to make sure we don't accelerate the ball or set the velocity

16
00:01:08,360 --> 00:01:09,370
of the ball quite so high.

17
00:01:09,380 --> 00:01:11,480
But again, we'll take care of that in just a little bit.

18
00:01:12,860 --> 00:01:14,000
So it's definitely works.

19
00:01:14,030 --> 00:01:18,410
So now the very last thing we really need to do to complete the entire game is to make sure that when

20
00:01:18,410 --> 00:01:24,440
the ball presses that completion block right there, we essentially end the game and say, Hey, congratulations,

21
00:01:24,440 --> 00:01:25,790
user, you just won.

22
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:28,340
That's the last major feature we need to add in.

23
00:01:28,340 --> 00:01:29,270
So quick pause.

24
00:01:29,270 --> 00:01:30,830
Take care of that in just a moment.
