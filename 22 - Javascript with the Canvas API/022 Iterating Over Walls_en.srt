1
00:00:00,680 --> 00:00:05,750
Now that we have formed up our verticals in horizontals arrays, we need to take those two arrays and

2
00:00:05,750 --> 00:00:11,510
use them to figure out where to draw the different walls on our canvas using matter JS.

3
00:00:11,600 --> 00:00:15,230
One thing I want to mention right away is that the different walls that we're going to show are going

4
00:00:15,230 --> 00:00:20,120
to be drawn using the rectangle shape that we've spoken about several times with Matthew excuse me,

5
00:00:20,120 --> 00:00:21,300
with Matt or Jess.

6
00:00:21,320 --> 00:00:25,850
So we're going to use a rectangle to represent each individual wall segment.

7
00:00:26,660 --> 00:00:31,250
So now we need to essentially just iterate over all of the verticals.

8
00:00:31,980 --> 00:00:33,480
And all the horizontals.

9
00:00:33,990 --> 00:00:39,690
And for every false value that we find inside those two arrays, we need to draw a rectangle onto our

10
00:00:39,690 --> 00:00:40,440
canvas.

11
00:00:41,010 --> 00:00:44,970
Let's first start off with horizontals and we're going to figure out how to iterate over that thing

12
00:00:44,970 --> 00:00:48,060
and then draw some number of rectangles using the data inside of it.

13
00:00:48,750 --> 00:00:54,030
So I'm going to go back down to the bottom of the file and down here I'm going to iterate over horizontals.

14
00:00:54,760 --> 00:00:56,890
Using a for each statement.

15
00:00:58,510 --> 00:01:01,820
Now I want you to recall that horizontals is a two dimensional array.

16
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:07,090
So when we do a four each on it, we're going to receive one of the inner arrays, and I'm going to

17
00:01:07,090 --> 00:01:09,100
refer that to that as a row.

18
00:01:09,640 --> 00:01:11,980
And inside of here, I'll do a console log of row.

19
00:01:13,190 --> 00:01:18,650
Just to verify that that is going to be a array of Boolean values that represent where I want to draw

20
00:01:18,650 --> 00:01:19,820
some wall segments.

21
00:01:20,330 --> 00:01:21,360
So I'm going to save this.

22
00:01:21,380 --> 00:01:23,420
I'm going to flip back over refresh.

23
00:01:23,660 --> 00:01:25,580
And there's the two console logs right there.

24
00:01:26,030 --> 00:01:28,660
So now we need to iterate over these two arrays.

25
00:01:28,670 --> 00:01:34,610
And whenever wherever we find a false value, that means that we need to draw a wall segment onto our

26
00:01:34,610 --> 00:01:35,390
canvas.

27
00:01:35,420 --> 00:01:37,220
Remember, false means there is a wall.

28
00:01:37,220 --> 00:01:39,050
True means there is no wall.

29
00:01:40,350 --> 00:01:44,340
So to iterate through those inner arrays, we'll do a row for each.

30
00:01:46,190 --> 00:01:50,120
And I'm going to receive each Boolean value as an argument that I will call open.

31
00:01:50,510 --> 00:01:54,800
The idea here behind calling it open is that we're essentially saying whether this is an open segment

32
00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:56,270
of wall or not.

33
00:01:56,360 --> 00:01:58,880
So if open is true, it means that it is open.

34
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:02,300
It's an open passageway and we do not need to draw a wall segment.

35
00:02:03,340 --> 00:02:09,310
Then inside of my for each the inner one, I'll say if open is true.

36
00:02:10,330 --> 00:02:11,620
Then just return.

37
00:02:11,620 --> 00:02:13,870
So we don't want to draw anything in this case.

38
00:02:14,410 --> 00:02:18,850
Now, of course, we don't actually have to do a comparison with true right here because open is a boolean

39
00:02:18,850 --> 00:02:19,480
already.

40
00:02:19,480 --> 00:02:23,440
So we can just take a look at Open and say, hey, if open is true, then return.

41
00:02:24,430 --> 00:02:24,760
So.

42
00:02:24,760 --> 00:02:29,440
Otherwise, if open is false, then we do want to draw a wall segment.

43
00:02:29,980 --> 00:02:36,580
So I'm going to create a new variable called Wall and we're going to create this out of bodies dot rectangle.

44
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:43,540
So we need to now decide on exactly what arguments we're going to throw inside of there, what arguments

45
00:02:43,540 --> 00:02:45,940
we're going to pass to Body Rectangle.

46
00:02:45,970 --> 00:02:51,160
Remember, the first two arguments are the X-Y values to the center of this rectangle.

47
00:02:51,780 --> 00:02:56,760
And the third and fourth arguments are going to be the length or the kind of width of the rectangle

48
00:02:56,760 --> 00:02:57,870
and the height.

49
00:02:58,610 --> 00:03:02,090
So calculating those values out is actually going to be just a little bit challenging.

50
00:03:02,090 --> 00:03:03,410
So let's take a quick pause right here.

51
00:03:03,410 --> 00:03:06,860
When we come back, the next video, I'm going to show you a couple of different diagrams to help you

52
00:03:06,860 --> 00:03:10,190
understand how we're going to calculate those different dimensions.
