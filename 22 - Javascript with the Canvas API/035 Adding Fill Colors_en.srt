1
00:00:00,960 --> 00:00:01,320
All right.

2
00:00:01,320 --> 00:00:04,980
The last thing I want to take care of inside of our maze is to just add in a little bit of color and

3
00:00:04,980 --> 00:00:09,300
also show a nice message to the user whenever they succeed so that they understand that they really

4
00:00:09,300 --> 00:00:10,770
did just win at the game.

5
00:00:11,340 --> 00:00:14,490
So we're going to take a look at some of the different shapes that we are creating.

6
00:00:14,910 --> 00:00:19,590
We're going to make sure that we add on a fill style to them to just color them in.

7
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:24,810
In addition, I'm going to make sure that when I create my render so here's our options object right

8
00:00:24,810 --> 00:00:25,200
here.

9
00:00:25,200 --> 00:00:27,900
I'm also going to flip wireframes to false.

10
00:00:28,020 --> 00:00:31,680
Remember, that is what's going to make all of our different shapes solid and allow us to apply some

11
00:00:31,680 --> 00:00:32,520
colors to them.

12
00:00:33,210 --> 00:00:37,830
So I'm going to update wireframes to false and we're going to go down and find where we create all of

13
00:00:37,830 --> 00:00:38,790
our different shapes.

14
00:00:39,270 --> 00:00:43,390
I'm going to leave the walls as essentially whatever random color we get assigned.

15
00:00:43,410 --> 00:00:44,630
I don't really care about those.

16
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:48,210
What I really care about is the different walls, the ball, and the goal.

17
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:51,240
So I'm going to go down to where we create.

18
00:00:52,130 --> 00:00:53,960
Our verticals and horizontals.

19
00:00:55,590 --> 00:00:57,840
Here's the horizontals for each right here.

20
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:00,540
I'm going to find where I create the wall.

21
00:01:00,900 --> 00:01:04,739
I'm going to add in a new property to this options object.

22
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:12,750
And remember, if we want to customize the color, we can add on a render option that they fill style

23
00:01:12,750 --> 00:01:14,570
and we'll specify the color that we want.

24
00:01:14,580 --> 00:01:16,410
So I'm going to try out a color of red.

25
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:20,970
I'll then go down to where we create our verticals.

26
00:01:22,150 --> 00:01:23,800
I'll find the wall that we create in there.

27
00:01:23,830 --> 00:01:25,330
I'll find the options object.

28
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:27,460
And I'll also put on a render.

29
00:01:28,270 --> 00:01:31,090
But they fill style of red.

30
00:01:34,290 --> 00:01:36,140
I'll go down to where we create our goal.

31
00:01:37,630 --> 00:01:39,550
I'm going to add on a render.

32
00:01:40,330 --> 00:01:42,130
But the fill style of green.

33
00:01:42,130 --> 00:01:44,500
So just make it a nice green that the user can understand.

34
00:01:44,500 --> 00:01:45,850
Hey, green is good, right?

35
00:01:46,910 --> 00:01:50,960
And then finally I'll find where we create the ball and the options object.

36
00:01:50,990 --> 00:01:54,910
I'll add on a render and a fill style of blue.

37
00:01:54,920 --> 00:01:56,120
So blue for the ball.

38
00:01:57,320 --> 00:01:57,410
Okay.

39
00:01:57,470 --> 00:01:58,490
So let's save this.

40
00:01:59,290 --> 00:02:01,240
I will flip back over refresh.

41
00:02:01,540 --> 00:02:03,820
And now we've got some interesting colouring going on.

42
00:02:04,150 --> 00:02:06,740
This is definitely a little bit easier to parse visually.

43
00:02:06,790 --> 00:02:08,320
A little bit more interesting as well.

44
00:02:08,740 --> 00:02:12,670
The only thing I don't quite like about it is that the ball is a very dark blue.

45
00:02:12,670 --> 00:02:16,510
So if you wanted to, you could try out some different colours and find one that maybe suits you better.

46
00:02:17,340 --> 00:02:18,260
Yes, it looks good.

47
00:02:18,270 --> 00:02:21,840
So now the last thing I want to do is to make sure once a user wins, we show a message on the very

48
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:24,390
center of the screen that says very clearly, hey, you won.

49
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:25,750
So another quick pause.

50
00:02:25,770 --> 00:02:27,570
Wrap this thing up in just a moment.
