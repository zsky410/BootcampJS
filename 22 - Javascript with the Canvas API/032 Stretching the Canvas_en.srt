1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:04,370
Well, now that we've got just about everything working as expected, let's start to think about how

2
00:00:04,370 --> 00:00:08,330
we're going to actually scale this entire game to fill up the entire screen.

3
00:00:08,420 --> 00:00:13,580
So I want to make sure that no matter what size browser window the user is using, I want this canvas

4
00:00:13,580 --> 00:00:17,420
to stretch from the very top left corner all the way down to the very bottom.

5
00:00:17,420 --> 00:00:18,050
Right.

6
00:00:18,620 --> 00:00:23,600
To do so, we're going to add in one CSS rule and we're going to change a couple of different variables

7
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:25,230
inside of our JavaScript file.

8
00:00:25,250 --> 00:00:27,710
It's just about all the logic is going to remain the same.

9
00:00:27,710 --> 00:00:33,260
We just have to make sure that at several different locations we respect a measurement in the Y direction

10
00:00:33,260 --> 00:00:38,960
and X direction as opposed to what's going on right now, where we just assume we always have an identical

11
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:40,820
width and height no matter what.

12
00:00:41,870 --> 00:00:42,940
So first things first.

13
00:00:42,950 --> 00:00:45,170
What's with the CSIS rule that I just mentioned?

14
00:00:45,530 --> 00:00:47,930
Well, if you open up your element, Inspector.

15
00:00:49,420 --> 00:00:51,880
And take a look at the body elements right now.

16
00:00:52,030 --> 00:00:56,440
You might notice that the body by default has a margin of eight pixels on it.

17
00:00:56,980 --> 00:01:02,050
So that is preventing our canvas right here from getting truly to the top left corner of the browser

18
00:01:02,050 --> 00:01:02,650
window.

19
00:01:03,160 --> 00:01:06,760
So let's make sure that we can just remove that default margin on the body.

20
00:01:07,590 --> 00:01:09,450
To do so i'll go back over to my editor.

21
00:01:09,870 --> 00:01:12,330
I'm going to open up the index.html html file.

22
00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:15,440
Here it is right here in the head element.

23
00:01:15,450 --> 00:01:17,220
I'll add in a style tag.

24
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:21,840
And then inside there, I'll select the body.

25
00:01:22,630 --> 00:01:24,970
And set margin to zero.

26
00:01:26,020 --> 00:01:29,620
That's going to remove that extra little bit of space around our canvas.

27
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:34,600
By now, refresh, I should see the canvas go truly up to the top left corner.

28
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:35,940
All right.

29
00:01:35,940 --> 00:01:40,170
So now how are we going to make sure that this canvas fills up the entire screen so from that corner

30
00:01:40,170 --> 00:01:40,860
down to the bottom.

31
00:01:40,860 --> 00:01:41,370
Right.

32
00:01:42,030 --> 00:01:46,760
Well, if you take a look at your console really quickly, I'm going to type out window right here.

33
00:01:46,770 --> 00:01:51,120
Remember, this is our window object, which is available to us by default when we are running JavaScript

34
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:52,260
code inside the browser.

35
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:58,170
One or two properties that this window object has is Windows inner with.

36
00:01:59,530 --> 00:02:01,600
And windows that inner height.

37
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:07,690
These two properties are going to give me the entire visible area where the dimensions of it that the

38
00:02:07,690 --> 00:02:08,979
user can see right now.

39
00:02:09,340 --> 00:02:14,140
So it's going to be from that top left corner, just right underneath the back button, all the way

40
00:02:14,140 --> 00:02:17,380
down to the bottom right corner of the viewable area.

41
00:02:17,410 --> 00:02:20,410
It does not include any space that is taken up by the console.

42
00:02:21,010 --> 00:02:25,510
So for example, if I pull the console out and then try to get the width again.

43
00:02:26,660 --> 00:02:29,660
I now get a width that is much greater than what I had just a moment ago.

44
00:02:30,170 --> 00:02:32,040
You can also see the inner height and width.

45
00:02:32,060 --> 00:02:34,710
If you are using chrome as you drag around the console.

46
00:02:34,730 --> 00:02:38,060
Just look at the top left hand corner or see me the top right hand corner right there.

47
00:02:38,390 --> 00:02:43,370
So as I pull over the console, I'll see that the visible area gets smaller and smaller.

48
00:02:44,460 --> 00:02:49,530
So we're going to use windows inner height and windows inner width to figure out exactly how large we

49
00:02:49,530 --> 00:02:50,760
want our canvas to be.

50
00:02:52,040 --> 00:02:55,580
So to get started, I'm going to go back over to my index file.

51
00:02:55,940 --> 00:02:58,790
I'm going to find where we set up height and width right here.

52
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:02,060
And we will pull those values from the window object.

53
00:03:02,660 --> 00:03:06,950
So I'll say windows inner width is going to be width.

54
00:03:07,990 --> 00:03:11,860
And windows at inner height is going to be height.

55
00:03:13,220 --> 00:03:18,620
Now, if I save this file right now and go back over and refresh, I will still see the maze up here

56
00:03:18,620 --> 00:03:21,800
and it's going to take up the full space available to us.

57
00:03:22,310 --> 00:03:26,780
If I close my console now and then refresh again, I'll see that it really does take up the entire browser

58
00:03:26,780 --> 00:03:27,350
window.

59
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:32,600
However, because of our maze logic, which assumes we always have equal dimensions for the height and

60
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:36,260
the width, well, the entire maze doesn't actually show up correctly.

61
00:03:36,590 --> 00:03:40,010
The ball is shown correctly and our square over here is showing correctly.

62
00:03:40,010 --> 00:03:43,430
But the actual walls are not really placed in the appropriate locations.

63
00:03:43,910 --> 00:03:47,210
So it's clear that we're still going to have to do a little bit more work to figure out how to get this

64
00:03:47,210 --> 00:03:48,290
thing to work correctly.

65
00:03:48,770 --> 00:03:49,790
So pause right here.

66
00:03:49,790 --> 00:03:53,990
We're going to come back the next video and discuss the big refactor that we're going to do to a couple

67
00:03:53,990 --> 00:03:57,740
of different variables inside of here to get everything else working the way we expect.
