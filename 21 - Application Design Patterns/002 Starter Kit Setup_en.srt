00:00:00,650 --> 00:00:04,939
Now that we have a better idea of what we're trying to build, let's get started working on this application.

2
00:00:04,970 --> 00:00:09,290
Before we write any code, however, I want to go through a couple of different steps here to make sure

3
00:00:09,290 --> 00:00:12,680
that we've got a really solid plan on how we're going to tackle this application.

4
00:00:13,220 --> 00:00:17,210
The first thing we're going to do is set up a little boilerplate for our project.

5
00:00:17,300 --> 00:00:21,770
So attached to this video there is a zip file that has some starter files inside of it.

6
00:00:22,130 --> 00:00:26,240
If you haven't downloaded that zip file already, then pause the video and download the zip file.

7
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:31,670
Right now I've already downloaded that zip file and I've extracted its contents onto my computer.

8
00:00:32,030 --> 00:00:37,250
So inside of that zip file are three different files the indexed HTML file, a JavaScript file, and

9
00:00:37,250 --> 00:00:38,360
a CSS file.

10
00:00:38,840 --> 00:00:43,580
Once you get those files on your computer, make sure you also open them up inside of your code editor.

11
00:00:43,580 --> 00:00:45,110
So I've already done that right here.

12
00:00:45,230 --> 00:00:49,040
Here's the HTML file, the JavaScript file, and the CSS one.

13
00:00:50,300 --> 00:00:54,600
And then finally make sure you open up the indexed HTML file inside of your browser.

14
00:00:54,620 --> 00:00:58,580
Once you do so, you're going to see a initial screen like this right here.

15
00:00:59,730 --> 00:01:00,030
Okay.

16
00:01:00,030 --> 00:01:04,440
So once we've got that all set up, I want to very quickly just mention exactly what this term boilerplate

17
00:01:04,440 --> 00:01:05,489
is referring to.

18
00:01:05,970 --> 00:01:11,430
When we talk about a boilerplate package, we're talking about some essentially starter code for a project.

19
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:16,080
Usually a boilerplate will have a little bit of setup already done inside of it, and usually it's going

20
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:22,350
to have some code or HTML or styling that is generally kind of repetitive between different projects.

21
00:01:22,350 --> 00:01:25,410
So it's really just a good starter point to begin from.

22
00:01:26,630 --> 00:01:31,310
I know that sometimes using a starter package is kind of annoying and you might prefer to write out

23
00:01:31,310 --> 00:01:34,250
everything from scratch so you really understand what is going on.

24
00:01:34,460 --> 00:01:39,680
Just so you know, the only real setup that I've done inside of this little boilerplate package is,

25
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:41,600
for the most part, just some styling.

26
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:47,420
So just some CSS to make sure that the end product that we end up with is going to look really nice.

27
00:01:47,930 --> 00:01:53,660
This is a course about JavaScript and not CSS, and that's why I did all the CSS for you up front.

28
00:01:53,930 --> 00:01:58,880
You can't, of course, review that CSS file at the end of this application and get a better idea of

29
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:00,860
what's going on inside there if you want to.

30
00:02:01,880 --> 00:02:02,310
Okay.

31
00:02:02,330 --> 00:02:06,440
So now that we've got a little bit of setup done, let's take a pause right here and then identify some

32
00:02:06,440 --> 00:02:09,410
challenging aspects of this project in the next video.
