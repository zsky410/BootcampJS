1
00:00:00,520 --> 00:00:04,840
Like I just mentioned, now that we've got this expanded piece of information about the movie, we're

2
00:00:04,840 --> 00:00:09,670
going to start to write out a lot of different HTML to get that kind of structure right there.

3
00:00:09,820 --> 00:00:13,990
We're going to end up printing out several different properties about the movie that are not shown inside

4
00:00:13,990 --> 00:00:14,710
this mockup.

5
00:00:14,950 --> 00:00:18,830
So in reality, we're not going to only show the box office taken critic rating.

6
00:00:18,850 --> 00:00:24,070
We're also going to show stuff like the awards that the movie won and the number of votes that it's

7
00:00:24,070 --> 00:00:27,850
gotten on IMDB, the rating on IMDB and so on.

8
00:00:27,850 --> 00:00:31,270
So a couple of other elements besides what is just pictured inside of here.

9
00:00:32,290 --> 00:00:37,030
Now I'm going to tell you right up front that we're going to write out a lot of HTML to get this structure

10
00:00:37,030 --> 00:00:38,080
inside this video.

11
00:00:38,110 --> 00:00:42,970
All the HTML that we are about to write in, all the class names are essentially taken directly from

12
00:00:42,970 --> 00:00:44,860
the Boma CSS framework.

13
00:00:44,890 --> 00:00:48,330
Remember, we discussed that this project is using this framework a little bit ago.

14
00:00:48,340 --> 00:00:53,740
So essentially I went through, I took a look at all the documentation and I figured out some HTML structure

15
00:00:53,740 --> 00:00:57,330
and class names that would give us something that looks like this right here.

16
00:00:57,340 --> 00:01:01,000
So I'm not making up all these class names and whatnot off the top of my head.

17
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:06,070
Instead, these are all corresponding to styling sets that are included inside of Boma.

18
00:01:07,030 --> 00:01:08,200
So let's go back over.

19
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,500
Yours on Movie Select right here.

20
00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:14,670
That's where we just got our response with all the information about one particular movie.

21
00:01:14,670 --> 00:01:19,470
So we're going to take that object right there, pull off a ton of different properties from it and

22
00:01:19,470 --> 00:01:21,810
stick it into some big HTML snippets.

23
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:24,360
This is going to end up being a lot of HTML.

24
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:29,040
So rather than stuffing it all inside of on Movie Select, I'm going to instead make another helper

25
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:32,010
function called Movie Template.

26
00:01:34,980 --> 00:01:39,360
I'm going to receive an argument to this function that I will call movie detail.

27
00:01:39,780 --> 00:01:41,540
I'm calling it movie detail right here.

28
00:01:41,550 --> 00:01:48,090
Just to be clear, that argument is going to be this really big object with all the specific properties

29
00:01:48,090 --> 00:01:52,410
of a movie, just to distinguish between the movie object that we had back up here.

30
00:01:52,410 --> 00:01:54,990
This movie object right here is more like a movie summary.

31
00:01:54,990 --> 00:02:00,300
It just has the title, the poster and like yea and one or two other properties, that's pretty much

32
00:02:00,300 --> 00:02:00,540
it.

33
00:02:00,540 --> 00:02:05,610
So I just want to have these two different variable names, movie versus movie detail, to indicate

34
00:02:05,610 --> 00:02:09,750
that this is just like an abbreviated object of all the different movie properties.

35
00:02:09,750 --> 00:02:13,590
This is like the detailed object about all the different movies properties.

36
00:02:14,540 --> 00:02:18,000
Then I'm going to Inside of here movie template.

37
00:02:18,020 --> 00:02:20,450
I'm going to return a multi-line string.

38
00:02:20,450 --> 00:02:22,310
So once again, set it back ticks.

39
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:26,330
And inside there we're going to write out a whole bunch of HTML.

40
00:02:26,330 --> 00:02:30,500
And again, this is all about getting that content right there on the screen.

41
00:02:30,500 --> 00:02:31,490
So let's get to it.

42
00:02:31,490 --> 00:02:32,300
A lot of writing.

43
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:34,370
So we're going to write that out rather quickly.

44
00:02:34,370 --> 00:02:37,190
Please triple check your spelling as you're going through this.

45
00:02:37,730 --> 00:02:40,910
So I'm going to do an article with a class of media.

46
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:43,760
I'll close off the article.

47
00:02:44,540 --> 00:02:50,120
I'll put in a figure with the class of media left close off the figure.

48
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:54,760
I'm going to do a paragraph element with a class of image.

49
00:02:57,290 --> 00:03:00,740
And inside there is an image with a Z.

50
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:05,210
I'm going to put in the double quotes because remember, we need those when we are trying to stick some

51
00:03:05,210 --> 00:03:10,870
image source inside of this tag and then we're going to get the poster property of the movie detail.

52
00:03:10,880 --> 00:03:13,610
So here's that object that we're working with right now.

53
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:16,760
We want that poster property right there with the capital P.

54
00:03:18,020 --> 00:03:25,160
So for the sauce I'll do dollar sign, curly braces and then movie detail dot poster with a capital

55
00:03:25,190 --> 00:03:25,670
P.

56
00:03:27,210 --> 00:03:29,370
Then I'll close off the image tag like so.

57
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:31,600
Okay.

58
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:32,830
So that's the first block.

59
00:03:33,190 --> 00:03:37,430
Now we're going to add on something after the closing figure tag.

60
00:03:37,450 --> 00:03:42,340
So after the closing figure tag, I'll do a div with the class of media dash content.

61
00:03:43,420 --> 00:03:45,480
Was off the div inside there.

62
00:03:45,490 --> 00:03:51,670
I'll do a div with the class of content clothes off the div and inside there I'll do an h one.

63
00:03:53,480 --> 00:03:55,850
I'm going to reference once again a JavaScript variable.

64
00:03:55,850 --> 00:03:59,810
So dollar sign, curly braces, I'll get movie detailed title.

65
00:03:59,810 --> 00:04:02,500
So that's going be the title of the movie as usual.

66
00:04:02,510 --> 00:04:04,340
Notice the capital T for title.

67
00:04:06,110 --> 00:04:12,140
I'll then do an H for and inside their movie detailed genre.

68
00:04:12,140 --> 00:04:13,550
So that's going to be the genre of the movie.

69
00:04:13,550 --> 00:04:18,350
So is it an action movie, a mystery, horror, suspense, drama, whatever else?

70
00:04:19,269 --> 00:04:22,200
And then after the H for a paragraph.

71
00:04:23,640 --> 00:04:26,610
With dollar sign curly brace and you want just to be consistent.

72
00:04:26,610 --> 00:04:29,220
This really should be on the same or a single line.

73
00:04:29,550 --> 00:04:33,000
So dollar sign, curly braces, movie, dot plot.

74
00:04:33,050 --> 00:04:35,370
That's going to be a plot summary of the movie.

75
00:04:36,780 --> 00:04:41,940
I want to remind you that all these movie detail properties, so poster titles, genre and plot should

76
00:04:41,940 --> 00:04:44,040
all have starting capital letters.

77
00:04:44,760 --> 00:04:46,220
Let's save this really quickly.

78
00:04:46,790 --> 00:04:48,970
We're going to try to call movie template.

79
00:04:48,980 --> 00:04:53,570
We're going to pass in our movie detail that we just got back from the API up here and then we're going

80
00:04:53,570 --> 00:04:55,580
to append that somewhere into the DOM.

81
00:04:55,820 --> 00:04:59,070
So we're essentially just going to test out just that snippet right there.

82
00:04:59,090 --> 00:05:03,260
We're not done with all the HTML that we need, but we've got enough that we should just do a very quick

83
00:05:03,260 --> 00:05:05,720
test to make sure that we don't have anything too crazy.

84
00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:07,570
Okay.

85
00:05:07,580 --> 00:05:11,780
So the first thing we need to do is to make sure that we have somewhere to render this template inside

86
00:05:11,780 --> 00:05:12,560
of our DOM.

87
00:05:12,860 --> 00:05:16,010
So I'm going to go back into my index.html file.

88
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:22,950
Right after my autocomplete element, I'm going to put in a div with an ID of summary.

89
00:05:24,640 --> 00:05:28,240
We are going to eventually replace this element, but we're just going to leave it here for now for

90
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:29,350
testing purposes.

91
00:05:30,580 --> 00:05:34,600
And then back inside of indexes I will find on movie select.

92
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:37,670
I'm going to delete the console log.

93
00:05:39,500 --> 00:05:42,110
I'll do a document query selector.

94
00:05:43,430 --> 00:05:47,570
And we're going to do a selector of pound and get that element that we just put in there.

95
00:05:47,570 --> 00:05:48,290
Summary.

96
00:05:51,540 --> 00:05:58,320
And then I'll say iner, each HTML will be essentially that string right there.

97
00:05:58,320 --> 00:06:02,010
So to get that string, we're going to call movie template.

98
00:06:02,940 --> 00:06:08,850
And we'll pass in response data, which is that big movie object that we just saw at our console just

99
00:06:08,850 --> 00:06:09,600
a moment ago.

100
00:06:11,130 --> 00:06:12,730
All right, so let's save this.

101
00:06:12,750 --> 00:06:15,270
We'll go back over and just do a quick test.

102
00:06:15,270 --> 00:06:19,230
Again, this is just to make sure that we don't have any errors in the HTML that we just wrote out.

103
00:06:19,860 --> 00:06:25,980
So I will again go for Avengers, click it and I think I've got a typo somewhere because it says here

104
00:06:25,980 --> 00:06:27,210
movie is not defined.

105
00:06:27,210 --> 00:06:31,110
So I definitely accidentally wrote out movie instead of Oh yep, right there.

106
00:06:31,110 --> 00:06:32,070
My mistake.

107
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:34,260
I put movie instead of movie detail.

108
00:06:34,290 --> 00:06:34,920
That's better.

109
00:06:36,850 --> 00:06:37,990
It's going to save that.

110
00:06:38,020 --> 00:06:38,950
Let's try it again.

111
00:06:40,450 --> 00:06:40,990
Avengers.

112
00:06:40,990 --> 00:06:41,690
Click it.

113
00:06:41,710 --> 00:06:42,610
There we go.

114
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:47,020
All right, so we've got something on the screen and it looks kind of reasonable right now, kind of

115
00:06:47,020 --> 00:06:50,890
looks very similar or somewhat similar to what we said we were trying to build right there.

116
00:06:51,640 --> 00:06:53,020
So this is good progress.

117
00:06:53,020 --> 00:06:54,250
Let's take a quick pause right here.

118
00:06:54,250 --> 00:06:58,480
When we come back, the next video, we're going to start to write out another block of HTML to show

119
00:06:58,480 --> 00:07:01,620
all the stats about the movie underneath what we have so far.

120
00:07:01,630 --> 00:07:03,790
So quick pause and I'll see you in just a minute.
