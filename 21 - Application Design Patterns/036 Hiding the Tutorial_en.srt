1
00:00:00,760 --> 00:00:05,290
The next thing we have to do is to make sure that whenever we click on a video inside of our autocomplete,

2
00:00:05,290 --> 00:00:10,270
we should hide this tutorial right here and start to show some summary information about that movie

3
00:00:10,270 --> 00:00:13,360
on the appropriate side, either the left side or the right side.

4
00:00:13,780 --> 00:00:16,870
So let's first take care of making sure that we just hide this thing.

5
00:00:17,470 --> 00:00:22,660
To do so, I'm going to go back over I'm going to go up into my config object and I'm going to find

6
00:00:22,660 --> 00:00:25,150
where we have the callback of on option select.

7
00:00:25,180 --> 00:00:26,140
Here it is right here.

8
00:00:26,530 --> 00:00:30,310
So I'm going to replace on option select or excuse me, I'm going to add to the code inside of it.

9
00:00:30,760 --> 00:00:34,750
I'm going to get a selector for that kind of tutorial window that we just added in.

10
00:00:35,080 --> 00:00:37,390
So inside my HTML file, here it is right here.

11
00:00:37,780 --> 00:00:42,790
So I'm going to get a selector for a div with the class of tutorial and then we're going to add a class

12
00:00:42,790 --> 00:00:44,980
to it that's going to hide that thing on the screen.

13
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:48,340
So inside of on option select, I'll do a document.

14
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,140
Where he selector.

15
00:00:52,760 --> 00:00:54,590
With Dot tutorial.

16
00:00:55,750 --> 00:00:57,910
I'm going to look at its class list.

17
00:00:58,310 --> 00:01:03,400
I'm going to add in a class of is dash hidden like so.

18
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,590
This is another one of those classes that is coming from the Boma CSS framework.

19
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:13,180
So by just adding on that class, that div that is containing the tutorial should be hidden on the screen.

20
00:01:13,720 --> 00:01:17,020
Let's do a save and a quick test so I'll flip back over.

21
00:01:17,590 --> 00:01:18,220
Refresh.

22
00:01:18,220 --> 00:01:20,800
Look for Avengers click and the thing is gone.

23
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:22,450
That was an easy one.

24
00:01:22,870 --> 00:01:26,770
Another quick pause right here and we'll continue with showing the two tutorials on both sides in just

25
00:01:26,770 --> 00:01:27,400
a moment.
