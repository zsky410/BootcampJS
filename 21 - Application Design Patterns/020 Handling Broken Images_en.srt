1
00:00:00,790 --> 00:00:01,000
Okay.

2
00:00:01,090 --> 00:00:02,770
So our autocomplete definitely looks great.

3
00:00:02,770 --> 00:00:06,320
But like I just mentioned, there's a couple more things we need to do for it.

4
00:00:06,340 --> 00:00:11,470
So first off, we need to make sure that whenever we fetch a new list of videos, we clear out the existing

5
00:00:11,470 --> 00:00:12,460
ones inside there.

6
00:00:12,830 --> 00:00:14,170
That's going to be pretty straightforward.

7
00:00:14,170 --> 00:00:15,880
So let's take care of that task first.

8
00:00:16,390 --> 00:00:20,140
So the big question here is when should we clear out the existing list?

9
00:00:20,650 --> 00:00:25,300
Well, remember, inside of On Input, we are making a request to fetch our data right here.

10
00:00:25,630 --> 00:00:31,300
After we fetch some data, we should probably clear out any existing items before we attempt to add

11
00:00:31,300 --> 00:00:32,290
any more in.

12
00:00:32,710 --> 00:00:38,110
So right above where we have dropdown class list add, let's add in some code to take a look at our

13
00:00:38,110 --> 00:00:39,090
results wrapper.

14
00:00:39,100 --> 00:00:42,910
Remember, that is the thing that is going to eventually contain all the different rendered results

15
00:00:42,910 --> 00:00:43,600
that we get.

16
00:00:44,690 --> 00:00:50,870
So right above dropdown class list add, I will add in results wrapper and to clear the thing out we

17
00:00:50,870 --> 00:00:55,040
could do a simple inner html is empty string like so.

18
00:00:56,360 --> 00:00:57,440
So let's save that.

19
00:00:57,620 --> 00:00:58,970
I'm going to flip back over.

20
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:00,800
Do a refresh.

21
00:01:02,590 --> 00:01:04,840
And I'll search for Avengers.

22
00:01:05,650 --> 00:01:07,990
And I'll do a search for Dark Knight.

23
00:01:08,700 --> 00:01:09,510
And there we go.

24
00:01:09,510 --> 00:01:10,470
That's much better.

25
00:01:10,860 --> 00:01:15,540
Now, one thing you might notice as I search for Dark Knight and you might see this or you might not.

26
00:01:15,690 --> 00:01:18,840
It looks like the last result in here has a broken image.

27
00:01:18,870 --> 00:01:21,810
And inside my console, I also see an error as well.

28
00:01:21,810 --> 00:01:25,620
So you might not see that it really depends upon the movie that you are searching for.

29
00:01:26,130 --> 00:01:30,600
Let's take a look at the API response that we're getting inside of our network request tab and try to

30
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:33,360
understand why we are seeing a broken image there.

31
00:01:34,110 --> 00:01:38,040
So I'm going to open up my most recent request to the API.

32
00:01:39,610 --> 00:01:42,580
I'm going to take a look at the list of results we get back.

33
00:01:42,790 --> 00:01:44,680
I'm going to select Dark Knight right there.

34
00:01:45,250 --> 00:01:50,620
So you'll notice that in this case, we have a poster property of an A, which means that there is no

35
00:01:50,620 --> 00:01:51,880
poster image available.

36
00:01:52,270 --> 00:01:55,840
Normally that poster is going to be the link to the actual image.

37
00:01:56,350 --> 00:02:01,150
So the reason that we're seeing this error is that we're essentially throwing in the string and a as

38
00:02:01,150 --> 00:02:06,790
an image source, and we can actually confirm that by inspecting that element, inspecting the image,

39
00:02:07,330 --> 00:02:12,640
and you'll see that the image very plainly has an CRC of an A, and that's why we're seeing this nasty

40
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:13,480
error down here.

41
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:18,540
So to get this fixed and again, you might not be seeing this yet, but you probably will eventually.

42
00:02:18,550 --> 00:02:24,160
We just have to add in a check for an A essentially, and make sure that if we ever see it, well,

43
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:26,830
we probably just don't want to show the image at all.

44
00:02:28,140 --> 00:02:29,910
So to do so, I'm going to go back over.

45
00:02:30,690 --> 00:02:34,680
I'm going to find where we create the inner HTML for each individual option.

46
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:36,930
So that's where we create the image right there.

47
00:02:37,930 --> 00:02:42,640
So all we have to do is add in a quick check beforehand to decide whether or not we want to show this

48
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:43,210
image.

49
00:02:44,530 --> 00:02:52,660
To do so right after we create the option, I'm going to say const image CRC like so.

50
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:56,260
And I'm going to use a little ternary expression here.

51
00:02:56,260 --> 00:03:03,820
So I'm going to say if item dot poster remember it, the capital P is equal to N slash a.

52
00:03:04,570 --> 00:03:08,890
Then I want to assign a value of empty string to image z.

53
00:03:09,460 --> 00:03:17,020
Otherwise, if it is not equal to n a, I want to you assign item capital P poster to image z instead.

54
00:03:18,230 --> 00:03:20,120
So again, this is a turner expression.

55
00:03:20,980 --> 00:03:23,440
We're going to first evaluate that expression right there.

56
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:29,380
If that is a true expression, then we're going to return whatever is between the question mark and

57
00:03:29,380 --> 00:03:30,040
the colon.

58
00:03:30,310 --> 00:03:34,960
Otherwise, if that is falsely, we will assign item poster over to image z.

59
00:03:35,500 --> 00:03:39,160
So now we can use image Z in place of movie poster.

60
00:03:39,610 --> 00:03:44,380
If we show an image element with an empty string, it's essentially just not going to show up inside

61
00:03:44,380 --> 00:03:48,070
the DOM Well, it's going to technically show up on the DOM, but it won't show up on the screen, which

62
00:03:48,070 --> 00:03:49,300
is going to solve this issue.

63
00:03:49,850 --> 00:03:52,570
So I'm going to put Image Z inside there like so.

64
00:03:53,880 --> 00:03:54,660
All right.

65
00:03:54,660 --> 00:03:57,960
So I'm going to refresh I'm going to look for Dark Knight again.

66
00:03:59,080 --> 00:04:01,560
And it looks like I probably made a typo inside there.

67
00:04:01,570 --> 00:04:02,860
Sorry, I called it item.

68
00:04:03,460 --> 00:04:04,530
It is not item.

69
00:04:04,540 --> 00:04:06,250
It is movie.

70
00:04:06,790 --> 00:04:07,430
That is better.

71
00:04:07,450 --> 00:04:08,230
My mistake.

72
00:04:09,530 --> 00:04:09,650
Yeah.

73
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:10,520
That's better.

74
00:04:10,730 --> 00:04:11,840
So I'll do dark night.

75
00:04:13,820 --> 00:04:16,510
And the last one down here don't have an image.

76
00:04:16,519 --> 00:04:17,279
Totally fine.

77
00:04:17,300 --> 00:04:18,019
I mean, that's life.

78
00:04:18,019 --> 00:04:19,339
There is no image to show.

79
00:04:19,370 --> 00:04:24,140
But we are not trying to show some, like, non-existing image and showing a broken image or anything

80
00:04:24,140 --> 00:04:24,800
like that.

81
00:04:25,070 --> 00:04:26,330
So this definitely looks good.

82
00:04:26,760 --> 00:04:31,190
So I think the last big thing we have to take care of is to make sure whenever a user clicks out of

83
00:04:31,190 --> 00:04:34,970
the input, like, I'm clicking over here right now, we need to make sure that we close this thing

84
00:04:34,970 --> 00:04:35,380
up.

85
00:04:35,390 --> 00:04:37,940
So let's figure out how we can do that in the next video.
