1
00:00:01,080 --> 00:00:01,440
All right.

2
00:00:01,440 --> 00:00:05,130
Last thing we really have to do here is to make sure that when a user selects one of those movies,

3
00:00:05,130 --> 00:00:07,410
we show a summary on the appropriate side of the screen.

4
00:00:07,770 --> 00:00:11,880
So the first thing we have to do is to make sure that we have some developments to render the summaries

5
00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:12,540
into.

6
00:00:12,570 --> 00:00:17,520
Remember, at the bottom of the indexed JS file, we still have the movie template function, so we

7
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:19,680
essentially know what content we want to show.

8
00:00:19,710 --> 00:00:22,500
We just need to make sure that we have some place to put it.

9
00:00:23,010 --> 00:00:28,350
So inside of indexed HTML, I'm going to find where my div of left autocomplete is.

10
00:00:28,380 --> 00:00:31,110
And right after it I'm going to add in a div.

11
00:00:31,870 --> 00:00:35,350
With an ID of left Daesh summary.

12
00:00:36,500 --> 00:00:40,970
And close it off and then I'll do the same thing right after the right autocomplete as well.

13
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,690
So it div with an ID of right dash summary.

14
00:00:46,080 --> 00:00:46,770
Like so.

15
00:00:48,290 --> 00:00:54,020
So now all we need to do is to make sure that whenever on Movie Select gets called, we render the summary

16
00:00:54,020 --> 00:00:57,740
into the appropriate element either the left side or the right side.

17
00:00:58,100 --> 00:01:03,980
So to make this happen, we're probably going to have to have two versions of either on Movie Select

18
00:01:03,980 --> 00:01:07,880
or two versions of on option select up here.

19
00:01:07,910 --> 00:01:13,280
Remember, right now we're using the same version of an option select between both the left hand side

20
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:15,050
autocomplete and the right hand side.

21
00:01:15,590 --> 00:01:20,930
So I think that we should probably take on options, select and then throw it down into each individual

22
00:01:20,930 --> 00:01:25,760
call to create autocomplete, and that will allow us to make a customized version for each one.

23
00:01:26,630 --> 00:01:29,300
So to do so, I'm going to go up to my autocomplete config.

24
00:01:30,190 --> 00:01:31,930
I'm going to cut on options.

25
00:01:31,930 --> 00:01:32,830
Select out.

26
00:01:35,320 --> 00:01:39,220
I'll then go down to my calls to create Autocomplete one and two.

27
00:01:40,090 --> 00:01:45,790
And I'm going to paste that thing in so paste and paste and I'll make sure that I get a comma on the

28
00:01:45,790 --> 00:01:46,480
line right above.

29
00:01:46,510 --> 00:01:48,220
Otherwise, I'll see an error very quickly.

30
00:01:49,970 --> 00:01:54,530
So now this one right here is for the left hand side, and this one right here is the right hand side.

31
00:01:54,980 --> 00:02:00,050
So to make sure that we actually render the summary into the appropriate element, let's make sure that

32
00:02:00,050 --> 00:02:05,600
when we call on movie select in both cases as a second element, I'm going to pass in a reference to

33
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:07,850
an element of where to render the summary to.

34
00:02:08,910 --> 00:02:15,990
So on the first one, which is responsible for the left hand side, I'll get a document where he selector.

35
00:02:17,070 --> 00:02:20,070
Or LB left dash summary.

36
00:02:20,860 --> 00:02:22,990
And I'll do the same thing for the second one as well.

37
00:02:23,590 --> 00:02:24,070
Document.

38
00:02:24,340 --> 00:02:25,780
Query selector.

39
00:02:26,950 --> 00:02:28,180
LB right.

40
00:02:28,180 --> 00:02:29,350
DASH Summary.

41
00:02:31,330 --> 00:02:34,780
So now inside of On Movie Select, we can receive that second argument.

42
00:02:35,410 --> 00:02:36,850
So in addition to movie.

43
00:02:37,790 --> 00:02:41,920
We received that other argument as like, how about summary target or something like that?

44
00:02:41,930 --> 00:02:43,190
How about summary element?

45
00:02:44,070 --> 00:02:45,060
I think that makes sense.

46
00:02:46,610 --> 00:02:50,690
So then we're going to do that request to get more details about the selected movie.

47
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:57,310
And then instead of throwing the render template inside of some summery element that doesn't exist anymore,

48
00:02:57,310 --> 00:03:01,180
instead we're going to throw it into the inner HTML of that summery element.

49
00:03:01,510 --> 00:03:05,740
So going to replace that query selector with summary element.

50
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:07,730
Okay.

51
00:03:07,730 --> 00:03:10,400
So let's save this and do a quick test.

52
00:03:10,850 --> 00:03:11,810
Go back over.

53
00:03:12,410 --> 00:03:17,120
I'll look for Avengers once again for the millionth time, click it and there's my summary on the left

54
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:23,510
hand side and I should be able to do Dark Night, look it and see the summary on the right hand side.

55
00:03:23,720 --> 00:03:28,010
Now I should be able to go between both these and just make sure that they've got the appropriate values,

56
00:03:28,010 --> 00:03:32,630
or I should just say different values to make sure that we're not accidentally leaking data from one

57
00:03:32,630 --> 00:03:33,500
side to another.

58
00:03:33,830 --> 00:03:36,080
So I'm looking through and yep, it all looks good.

59
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:37,420
Okay.

60
00:03:37,420 --> 00:03:40,750
So now the very last thing we have to do here to really complete our application.

61
00:03:40,750 --> 00:03:46,510
Remember, the last requirement of our project was to compare both the different stats and we need to

62
00:03:46,510 --> 00:03:50,260
make sure that we color the greater stat on each side of the screen.

63
00:03:50,770 --> 00:03:55,330
This is going to be a little bit more challenging than it seems because in some cases comparing these

64
00:03:55,330 --> 00:03:57,040
things is actually kind of challenging.

65
00:03:58,050 --> 00:04:02,580
For example, how do we really compare this string right here with this string?

66
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:04,990
How do we compare this number right here?

67
00:04:05,010 --> 00:04:07,020
This is a string when it comes back from the API.

68
00:04:07,050 --> 00:04:11,130
We know it's a string because it has the dollar sign and the commas in there.

69
00:04:11,130 --> 00:04:13,680
So how do we compare that string versus that string?

70
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:18,450
It's pretty clear, I think, that we're going to have to figure out some ways to really compare these

71
00:04:18,450 --> 00:04:19,320
different statistics.

72
00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:21,899
And in some cases, it might require some special logic.

73
00:04:22,230 --> 00:04:25,710
So one last pause and we're going to figure that stuff out in the next video.
