1
00:00:00,680 --> 00:00:04,970
Our autocomplete has a couple of things fixed up now, so we get to now start to think about adding

2
00:00:04,970 --> 00:00:06,560
in some additional features to it.

3
00:00:06,680 --> 00:00:11,210
The next thing we need to do is to make sure that once a user searches for something and then clicks

4
00:00:11,210 --> 00:00:14,630
on an option right here, we have to somehow handle that click.

5
00:00:14,930 --> 00:00:18,590
We spoke about what to do whenever a user clicks on an entry a little bit ago.

6
00:00:18,590 --> 00:00:22,250
So remember we had said that we want to update the text inside the input.

7
00:00:22,250 --> 00:00:27,680
So we want to update the text from whatever the user had just typed, like Avenger's right here to the

8
00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:30,330
exact title of the movie that the user clicked on.

9
00:00:30,350 --> 00:00:34,940
So instead of saying Avengers, it should say The Avengers inside of that input.

10
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:38,540
In addition, we need to make sure that we also close the menu.

11
00:00:39,450 --> 00:00:43,440
Finally and this isn't really in this diagram right here, but the last thing we need to do as well

12
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:48,360
is to make sure that whatever movie a user clicks on, we need to essentially render it out really large

13
00:00:48,360 --> 00:00:52,440
on the left hand side of the screen because that is the end goal of this application.

14
00:00:52,710 --> 00:00:57,570
But right now, let's just make sure that whenever we search for something and click on it, we update

15
00:00:57,570 --> 00:00:59,760
the text and we close the dropdown.

16
00:01:00,530 --> 00:01:05,540
So what we really need to do here is to detect a click on an individual option.

17
00:01:05,750 --> 00:01:08,870
To do so, I'm going to once again find my on input function.

18
00:01:09,050 --> 00:01:14,540
Inside of there, we've got our four of loop where we create a bunch of different anchor elements.

19
00:01:15,020 --> 00:01:19,130
We then add on some classes and set some inner HTML and whatnot.

20
00:01:19,550 --> 00:01:25,760
So to detect a click on one of those options, we can add in a click event handler to that option variable.

21
00:01:25,790 --> 00:01:28,610
Remember, the option variable is an anchor element.

22
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:33,360
To add in a click event handler right underneath where we set the inner HTML.

23
00:01:33,390 --> 00:01:41,280
I'm going to do an option dot add event listener and we're going to watch for a not a click event,

24
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:42,300
but a click event.

25
00:01:44,810 --> 00:01:48,120
So then inside of here, we can do the two things we just discussed.

26
00:01:48,140 --> 00:01:53,180
We want to update the value of the input, and we also want to make sure that we close the dropdown

27
00:01:53,180 --> 00:01:53,900
as well.

28
00:01:54,510 --> 00:01:57,170
Let's see, the dropdown is something that we've spoke about several times now.

29
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:59,870
Remember to toggle whether or not the dropdown is open.

30
00:01:59,870 --> 00:02:01,190
We add or remove.

31
00:02:01,190 --> 00:02:07,880
The class is active to the dropdown element and the dropdown element is that one right there.

32
00:02:09,229 --> 00:02:10,610
So let's take care of that first.

33
00:02:10,820 --> 00:02:12,390
Inside of my event listener.

34
00:02:12,410 --> 00:02:16,040
I'll do a dropdown class list.

35
00:02:16,370 --> 00:02:17,270
Remove.

36
00:02:17,630 --> 00:02:19,550
Is Daesh active?

37
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:22,680
So let's save that and do a very quick test.

38
00:02:23,490 --> 00:02:24,510
I'll refresh.

39
00:02:25,330 --> 00:02:26,050
Avengers.

40
00:02:26,050 --> 00:02:29,970
So now I'm going to click on The Avengers and the entire dropdown closes.

41
00:02:29,980 --> 00:02:30,730
Very good.

42
00:02:31,030 --> 00:02:34,780
So now the next thing we need to do is to make sure that we update the text inside of the input.

43
00:02:35,110 --> 00:02:40,150
Once again, remember that we've got a reference to that input on the input variable right there.

44
00:02:41,300 --> 00:02:46,640
So we can update the value of that text input by going back down to our event listener.

45
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:47,900
And we'll say input.

46
00:02:48,790 --> 00:02:49,720
Dot value.

47
00:02:49,720 --> 00:02:53,020
That's how we can change the value inside of an existing input.

48
00:02:53,080 --> 00:02:56,920
And we're going to update it to the title of the movie that the user just clicked on.

49
00:02:57,310 --> 00:03:02,530
We can get the title of the movie that the user just clicked on by using the closure scope of this function

50
00:03:02,530 --> 00:03:03,040
right here.

51
00:03:03,070 --> 00:03:07,390
Remember, the closure scope is essentially everything outside of that arrow function.

52
00:03:07,660 --> 00:03:12,250
So right outside that function, we've still got a reference to the movie variable, and that is the

53
00:03:12,250 --> 00:03:16,120
object that has all the information about the movie that the user just clicked on.

54
00:03:16,300 --> 00:03:19,480
So we could do movie title.

55
00:03:19,630 --> 00:03:24,970
And as I've mentioned many times, remember title with a capital TX because this API property names

56
00:03:24,970 --> 00:03:26,470
are just a little bit strange.

57
00:03:27,650 --> 00:03:32,300
So we're going to take that title, shove it into input value, and that should update the text on the

58
00:03:32,300 --> 00:03:33,920
screen inside the input.

59
00:03:34,460 --> 00:03:35,810
So let's do another save here.

60
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:40,560
I'll flip back over, refresh, I'll search for Avengers.

61
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:44,850
And now if I click on any of these right here, I would expect to see the text inside of the input update

62
00:03:44,850 --> 00:03:45,450
as well.

63
00:03:45,810 --> 00:03:46,710
And there we go.

64
00:03:46,950 --> 00:03:47,640
Very good.

65
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:49,070
Okay.

66
00:03:49,130 --> 00:03:51,720
So this looks like we've got something pretty good put together now.

67
00:03:51,740 --> 00:03:54,890
I would say that our autocomplete element is just about done.

68
00:03:54,890 --> 00:03:58,850
So now the last thing we have to do is think about how to take the movie that the user just clicked

69
00:03:58,850 --> 00:04:04,760
on and render out some details about it on the screen, just like we said we would do with the original

70
00:04:04,760 --> 00:04:06,890
mockups of this application.

71
00:04:06,890 --> 00:04:11,600
So like this right here, we want to show the image title, some statistics and so on.

72
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:15,110
So another quick pause and we'll start to address that in the next video.
