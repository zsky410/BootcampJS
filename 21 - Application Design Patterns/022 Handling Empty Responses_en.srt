00:00:00,620 --> 00:00:04,780
There's one last fix I want to take care of very quickly right now, if we do a search for something,

2
00:00:04,790 --> 00:00:06,400
so I'm going to search for Avengers.

3
00:00:06,420 --> 00:00:08,570
Oops, I accidentally lost it.

4
00:00:08,570 --> 00:00:09,230
There we go.

5
00:00:09,710 --> 00:00:11,300
And then I delete this.

6
00:00:12,330 --> 00:00:17,070
The input stays open or excuse me, the dropdown stays open, but with nothing inside of it, which

7
00:00:17,070 --> 00:00:18,750
is definitely not appropriate.

8
00:00:18,900 --> 00:00:22,890
So we just need to make sure that we do a little check inside of our code and we say that if we get

9
00:00:22,890 --> 00:00:27,720
back no results at all from our fetch data function, we should probably close the dropdown.

10
00:00:28,170 --> 00:00:30,360
So we just spoke about how we open and close the dropdown.

11
00:00:30,360 --> 00:00:31,800
So this should be pretty straightforward.

12
00:00:32,340 --> 00:00:36,750
Back up right after we check to see if we are assuming it right after we get some data.

13
00:00:36,750 --> 00:00:41,370
Let's take a look at movies and we're going to say that if there are no movies whatsoever, if we didn't

14
00:00:41,370 --> 00:00:45,960
fetch any data, let's just return early and not run anything else inside of here.

15
00:00:47,720 --> 00:00:49,160
So I'm going to say if.

16
00:00:50,130 --> 00:00:52,470
Not movies, not length.

17
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:57,000
So if there are no movies, then let's make sure that we close the dropdown.

18
00:00:57,120 --> 00:00:59,070
So I'm going to do a dropdown.

19
00:01:00,190 --> 00:01:07,090
Class list dot remove is active and then we're going to return entirely from this function because we

20
00:01:07,090 --> 00:01:12,430
don't want to try to render anything or even open the dropdown back up or anything like that.

21
00:01:13,180 --> 00:01:14,200
So that's pretty much it.

22
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:16,060
Let's do a quick save and a test.

23
00:01:16,450 --> 00:01:19,930
I'm going to once again search for Avengers and I'll delete it.

24
00:01:20,730 --> 00:01:22,020
In the drop down goes away.

25
00:01:23,060 --> 00:01:23,450
All right.

26
00:01:23,450 --> 00:01:24,890
Well, I'd say that's looking pretty good.

27
00:01:25,070 --> 00:01:30,740
So our autocomplete widget is now in a really good state, and there's really only one last major interaction

28
00:01:30,740 --> 00:01:31,650
we have to add.

29
00:01:31,670 --> 00:01:35,420
We need to make sure that a user can actually click on a video to select it.

30
00:01:35,450 --> 00:01:39,290
Right now, we can click on a video all day, but nothing is really happening.

31
00:01:39,470 --> 00:01:43,880
So let's take a quick pause and handle that last major interaction in the next video.
