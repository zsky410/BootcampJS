1
00:00:00,620 --> 00:00:05,400
Last thing we have to do is make sure that we get a comparison going between all these different stats.

2
00:00:05,410 --> 00:00:11,050
So back inside of my index file, I'm going to find where we were just working on on Movie Select.

3
00:00:11,530 --> 00:00:16,420
We're going to eventually do a request inside of here, remember to get some follow up details about

4
00:00:16,420 --> 00:00:17,500
a particular movie.

5
00:00:18,130 --> 00:00:22,540
Now, one thing we should probably do inside of here is get a reference or story, a reference to that

6
00:00:22,540 --> 00:00:27,430
response that comes back so we can hold on to that reference, that movie, in all those different statistics,

7
00:00:27,430 --> 00:00:29,620
so we can do an easy comparison later on.

8
00:00:30,470 --> 00:00:35,000
So right above on Movie Select, I'm going to define it two variables with the keyword.

9
00:00:35,030 --> 00:00:40,250
So I'll say let left movie and right movie.

10
00:00:41,310 --> 00:00:46,500
Then inside this function, after we get some data back from Axios, let's make sure that we store the

11
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:49,020
movie that we just fetched on the appropriate variable.

12
00:00:49,530 --> 00:00:54,780
To do so, we're going to need to make sure that we pass in some additional argument here to indicate

13
00:00:54,780 --> 00:00:58,350
whether we are receiving the movie on the left side or the right side.

14
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:05,519
So inside of both the functions where we call on Movie Select, I'm going to pass in one last variable

15
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:11,100
here of left as a string and right as a string.

16
00:01:11,430 --> 00:01:14,700
So now we know the context in which on movie select is being called.

17
00:01:16,210 --> 00:01:20,170
So inside of here, I'm going to receive that as variable that I'll call simply side.

18
00:01:21,880 --> 00:01:28,840
And then right after we set that in our HTML, we can say something like If side equals left, then

19
00:01:28,840 --> 00:01:31,140
let's update the left movie variable.

20
00:01:31,150 --> 00:01:34,870
So I'll say left movie is response dot data.

21
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:37,450
Else we must be working with the right side.

22
00:01:37,450 --> 00:01:39,070
So I'll say right movie.

23
00:01:40,170 --> 00:01:41,700
Is response data.

24
00:01:43,440 --> 00:01:48,690
Then after we update both those variables, we should add in a check to see if both the left movie and

25
00:01:48,690 --> 00:01:50,130
right movie are defined.

26
00:01:50,160 --> 00:01:54,420
If both these variables are defined, that means we have a movie on both sides of the screen and it's

27
00:01:54,420 --> 00:01:55,800
time to run the comparison.

28
00:01:56,450 --> 00:01:59,330
So after those if ll statements, I'll say if.

29
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:02,710
Left movie.

30
00:02:03,590 --> 00:02:05,180
And Wright's movie.

31
00:02:05,450 --> 00:02:07,400
Then let's run the comparison.

32
00:02:07,640 --> 00:02:11,960
I'm going to stick all the code for doing the comparison into a helper function called appropriately

33
00:02:11,960 --> 00:02:14,090
named Run Comparison.

34
00:02:15,290 --> 00:02:18,410
And I'll define that as a helper function right after.

35
00:02:21,080 --> 00:02:26,150
So then inside of here we can iterate through our two different movies, run all the comparisons, and

36
00:02:26,150 --> 00:02:29,750
then update the appropriate statistics on both sides of the screen.

37
00:02:30,620 --> 00:02:35,960
So inside of here, I'm going to do a quick console log for right now and say time for comparison just

38
00:02:35,960 --> 00:02:38,420
to make sure that we are running this code at the appropriate time.

39
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:42,410
I'll then go back over, refresh, get that console open.

40
00:02:43,350 --> 00:02:45,630
And then I'll do Avengers.

41
00:02:46,590 --> 00:02:47,220
Here we go.

42
00:02:47,550 --> 00:02:49,170
And Dark Knight.

43
00:02:49,410 --> 00:02:53,040
And after I click this movie, it would then be, in theory, time to run the comparison.

44
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:55,740
So I'd expect to see the console log up here at that time.

45
00:02:55,890 --> 00:02:58,740
So I'll click there and I do, in fact see time for comparison.

46
00:02:59,490 --> 00:03:01,080
So it looks like we're off to a good start.

47
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:02,250
So now another quick pause.

48
00:03:02,250 --> 00:03:05,760
We'll come back to the next video and figure out how we're going to actually compare all these different

49
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:06,660
statistics.
