1
00:00:00,490 --> 00:00:02,080
Our first test worked out pretty well.

2
00:00:02,080 --> 00:00:04,330
So let's continue on with this refactor.

3
00:00:04,360 --> 00:00:06,540
I'm inside of my indexed JS file.

4
00:00:06,550 --> 00:00:10,530
Inside of here we've got the three create autocomplete function calls in a row.

5
00:00:10,540 --> 00:00:12,970
We don't really need three different auto completes.

6
00:00:12,970 --> 00:00:16,930
I just did that for testing purposes, so I'm going to delete the two.

7
00:00:17,710 --> 00:00:18,510
Right there.

8
00:00:18,520 --> 00:00:21,550
And we're going to go back to just one call to create autocomplete.

9
00:00:22,350 --> 00:00:26,970
I'm also going to go to my index.html file and remove those two extra divs.

10
00:00:29,430 --> 00:00:30,000
All right.

11
00:00:30,330 --> 00:00:32,369
So let's continue on with this refactor.

12
00:00:32,369 --> 00:00:37,950
I want to continue to add in some additional functions to that config object that we're passing to the

13
00:00:37,950 --> 00:00:39,600
create autocomplete function.

14
00:00:40,050 --> 00:00:45,180
We're then going to refactor the function to make sure that it uses the functions we had provided instead

15
00:00:45,180 --> 00:00:49,290
of locating all that logic directly inside of the create autocomplete function.

16
00:00:49,860 --> 00:00:53,610
So I think the next one we should try working on is render option.

17
00:00:53,610 --> 00:00:58,590
So this is going to be a function that is going to be called with each different option or each kind

18
00:00:58,590 --> 00:01:01,380
of object that we're getting back from that API.

19
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:06,780
We're going to pass it into this function and that function needs to return some kind of string.

20
00:01:06,780 --> 00:01:10,440
That's going to be the HTML that shows up inside of the dropdown.

21
00:01:11,620 --> 00:01:14,830
So in short, if we go back over to autocomplete JWs.

22
00:01:15,830 --> 00:01:17,360
Here is create autocomplete.

23
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:24,230
And if we go down to our four of loop right now, right about here essentially where we're setting the

24
00:01:24,230 --> 00:01:30,290
inner HTML of the option, remember we had said that this is assuming 100% that we always want to show

25
00:01:30,290 --> 00:01:33,170
in image and then the title right next to it.

26
00:01:33,170 --> 00:01:36,740
But we might decide that we want our autocomplete to work in some very different way.

27
00:01:36,740 --> 00:01:39,350
Like, for example, maybe we won't have an image at all.

28
00:01:40,030 --> 00:01:44,920
So right now this would be really challenging to customize because this is code that is located inside

29
00:01:44,920 --> 00:01:49,690
of our autocomplete file, which we want to be as reusable as possible.

30
00:01:50,170 --> 00:01:56,020
So instead, I want to extract the logic that decides what this thing looks like to a helper function

31
00:01:56,020 --> 00:01:57,790
on that config object.

32
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:03,420
We're going to assume that that helper function is going to be called with each movie object that we

33
00:02:03,420 --> 00:02:04,530
are iterating over.

34
00:02:04,860 --> 00:02:07,770
Now, I know you see the variable movie inside of here quite a bit still.

35
00:02:07,770 --> 00:02:12,180
And like I'm still using the term movie, we are going to eventually refactor the terminology inside

36
00:02:12,180 --> 00:02:14,070
of here to not refer to movie anymore.

37
00:02:14,100 --> 00:02:15,870
I just want to throw that out there really quickly.

38
00:02:17,130 --> 00:02:17,480
Okay.

39
00:02:17,490 --> 00:02:23,190
So back inside of our index case file, I'm going to find where we create the autocomplete.

40
00:02:23,870 --> 00:02:27,200
I'm going to pass in a second property into this object.

41
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:30,050
I'm going to call it render option.

42
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:37,170
We could make this a function like, so we could also assign it as an arrow function.

43
00:02:37,170 --> 00:02:38,550
No difference whatsoever.

44
00:02:38,550 --> 00:02:40,380
We can really use either syntax.

45
00:02:41,260 --> 00:02:47,680
So passed into this function, I'm going to expect to receive some object like each individual object

46
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:53,230
that represents some possible movie or whatever else, and I'll just refer to it as movie.

47
00:02:54,170 --> 00:02:57,440
Then inside we're going to generate some HTML and return it.

48
00:02:57,440 --> 00:03:00,560
And this will be the HTML to get shown for each individual option.

49
00:03:01,290 --> 00:03:04,470
So we're going to have to extract all the logic we had around that.

50
00:03:04,470 --> 00:03:09,990
It's not only the HTML right there, we also have to extract that line where we got the Image CRC as

51
00:03:09,990 --> 00:03:15,240
remember in some cases the poster link was an A and we needed to make sure we handled that as well.

52
00:03:16,070 --> 00:03:18,830
So I'm going to take the Image Z line right there.

53
00:03:18,860 --> 00:03:19,910
I'm going to cut it.

54
00:03:20,950 --> 00:03:23,770
I'm going to go paste it back inside of render option.

55
00:03:25,730 --> 00:03:29,250
I'll then go and get the inner HTML that we had created right here.

56
00:03:29,270 --> 00:03:30,230
I'm going to cut it.

57
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:33,900
Go back over to render option.

58
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:36,630
I'll paste it in here and return it.

59
00:03:38,330 --> 00:03:43,670
So now we have extracted all of our rendering logic into this render option function, and it's going

60
00:03:43,670 --> 00:03:47,990
to be called many times automatically with each movie that the autocomplete fetches.

61
00:03:49,410 --> 00:03:54,120
So now we just need to make sure that the create autocomplete function references this function to figure

62
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:56,070
out what each option should look like.

63
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:59,080
So to do so, we'll go back over to the other file.

64
00:03:59,930 --> 00:04:01,460
We're going to go up to the very top.

65
00:04:03,630 --> 00:04:08,080
We're going to make sure that we structure off the render option function.

66
00:04:09,240 --> 00:04:11,910
Then we'll go back down to that same four of loop.

67
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:15,080
Here it is right here.

68
00:04:15,810 --> 00:04:18,930
I'll find where I left the option in or HTML.

69
00:04:18,930 --> 00:04:25,380
So to generate the HTML to show for this option, we're going to call render option with the movie that

70
00:04:25,380 --> 00:04:26,880
we are currently iterating over.

71
00:04:27,880 --> 00:04:28,900
And there we go.

72
00:04:29,530 --> 00:04:35,170
So now, once again, we've extracted some custom logic that is only appropriate for this movie related

73
00:04:35,170 --> 00:04:35,770
stuff.

74
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:39,370
And if we ever decide that we want the autocomplete to look very different.

75
00:04:39,370 --> 00:04:44,350
So if you want to generate some HTML for each individual option, we only have to update the render

76
00:04:44,350 --> 00:04:47,000
option function back inside of index js.

77
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:51,010
So I'll now save this and do a quick test.

78
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:52,680
Back over here.

79
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:53,610
I'll refresh.

80
00:04:54,150 --> 00:04:57,030
I'll look for Avengers and I still see the same thing.

81
00:04:57,480 --> 00:05:02,700
Let's try making a change to the render option function just to see how easy it is now to make a change

82
00:05:02,700 --> 00:05:04,290
and get something that looks slightly different.

83
00:05:04,830 --> 00:05:09,690
As a quick reminder inside of the data that we get back from our API, it contains the year that the

84
00:05:09,690 --> 00:05:10,800
movie was created.

85
00:05:10,950 --> 00:05:14,790
So let's try printing out the year that the movie was created next to each option as well.

86
00:05:15,330 --> 00:05:18,690
So to do so, I no longer this is the entire key right here.

87
00:05:18,690 --> 00:05:20,880
This is the part to like listen to.

88
00:05:20,910 --> 00:05:26,550
In other words, I no longer have to go hunting through and searching through all the source code of

89
00:05:26,550 --> 00:05:31,370
the create autocomplete function to figure out how to change what each individual item looks like.

90
00:05:31,380 --> 00:05:37,130
Instead, I can look at my render option function right here, which is very appropriately named.

91
00:05:37,140 --> 00:05:41,970
If I see that name, chances are I would think to myself, Oh, this is where we decide how to change

92
00:05:41,970 --> 00:05:43,800
what each individual option looks like.

93
00:05:44,310 --> 00:05:49,530
So then inside of here, right after the movie title, I could put down like maybe a set of parentheses

94
00:05:49,530 --> 00:05:54,750
and then inside there print out using dollar sign and curly brace movie dot yea.

95
00:05:56,180 --> 00:05:57,320
So we can save that.

96
00:05:57,350 --> 00:05:59,120
Go back over, refresh.

97
00:05:59,450 --> 00:06:00,880
Look for Avengers again.

98
00:06:00,890 --> 00:06:02,750
And now I see the year on there.

99
00:06:03,320 --> 00:06:07,640
So hopefully this change is a little bit more meaningful when we start talking about all this refactoring

100
00:06:07,640 --> 00:06:09,890
and kind of reusable logic stuff.

101
00:06:10,280 --> 00:06:14,930
It is the presence of this function right here that will make it really clear to other engineers how

102
00:06:14,930 --> 00:06:20,540
to customize and get some version of the autocomplete that works for their particular application.

103
00:06:20,900 --> 00:06:25,460
I'm sure you can imagine that if we wanted to make even more changes to how each individual option looks,

104
00:06:25,460 --> 00:06:28,160
we would just make some more changes to render option.

105
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:29,060
And that's it.

106
00:06:30,130 --> 00:06:30,220
Okay.

107
00:06:30,280 --> 00:06:34,630
So hopefully now you're starting to get a little bit more sense of the purpose of this whole refactor.

108
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:37,960
So let's take a quick pause right here and continue in the next video.
