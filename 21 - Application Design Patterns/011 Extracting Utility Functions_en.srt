1
00:00:00,920 --> 00:00:02,540
Our demon's function is all done.

2
00:00:02,540 --> 00:00:04,939
But there's one last, very quick thing I want to do with it.

3
00:00:05,150 --> 00:00:09,290
Our index file is already getting a pretty good amount of code inside of it.

4
00:00:09,320 --> 00:00:14,300
Right now we're at just 29 lines of code and we've barely really begun to start our application.

5
00:00:14,690 --> 00:00:19,730
So I think that we could be well served to move this bounce function out into a separate file.

6
00:00:20,270 --> 00:00:23,900
Inside of my root project directory, I'm going to make a new file called Utils.

7
00:00:24,180 --> 00:00:29,780
JS The idea behind this file is that I'm going to place any utility functions that I create inside of

8
00:00:29,780 --> 00:00:30,210
here.

9
00:00:30,230 --> 00:00:33,620
So this is just so I can better organize the code inside of my project.

10
00:00:34,250 --> 00:00:36,230
I'm going to go find the bounce function.

11
00:00:36,710 --> 00:00:41,210
I'm going to cut it, move it over to utils eggs and paste it.

12
00:00:43,190 --> 00:00:47,440
I then need to make sure that I include the utilized JS file inside of my HTML document.

13
00:00:47,450 --> 00:00:49,430
So I'm going to open up the HTML document.

14
00:00:49,730 --> 00:00:51,710
I'm going to go down to the very bottom of the file.

15
00:00:52,070 --> 00:00:57,650
I'll find the existing script tag for indexed JS and I'm going to copy it and paste it right underneath

16
00:00:57,650 --> 00:00:58,310
itself.

17
00:00:59,040 --> 00:01:03,420
I'll then find the first script tag and change the source to utilize JJ's.

18
00:01:04,260 --> 00:01:09,420
So now whenever we load up this HTML document are going to first load up and execute all the code inside

19
00:01:09,420 --> 00:01:16,650
of utils that will define the bounds function well then load up and execute indexed JS which has a reference

20
00:01:16,650 --> 00:01:17,760
to bounce.

21
00:01:18,090 --> 00:01:23,760
So we need to make sure that we define UTILS first or include that file first so that we can define

22
00:01:23,760 --> 00:01:27,780
the bounce function before we run it inside of indexes.

23
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:28,820
Okay.

24
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,880
So let's save all these files and make sure all three are saved.

25
00:01:32,480 --> 00:01:35,330
I'll then go back over to my browser, do a quick refresh.

26
00:01:36,610 --> 00:01:40,860
I'll search for Avengers again, and I'm just going to make sure that I still see my data getting fetched.

27
00:01:40,870 --> 00:01:42,340
And yep, I definitely do.

28
00:01:43,080 --> 00:01:43,510
Okay.

29
00:01:43,530 --> 00:01:44,470
Quick little change.

30
00:01:44,490 --> 00:01:45,420
All good to go.

31
00:01:45,450 --> 00:01:48,450
Let's take another quick pause and continue with our app in the next video.
