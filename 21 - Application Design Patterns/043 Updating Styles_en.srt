1
00:00:00,790 --> 00:00:01,700
All right, let's get to it.

2
00:00:01,720 --> 00:00:03,800
Let's run our comparison on both sides.

3
00:00:03,820 --> 00:00:07,750
The first thing we have to do is select all of these different articles, and we need to make sure that

4
00:00:07,750 --> 00:00:09,730
we keep the two different sets separate.

5
00:00:09,790 --> 00:00:15,040
As a quick reminder, if we open up our element, Inspector, again, the entire summary on the left

6
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:19,830
hand side is enclosed inside of a div with an ID of left summary.

7
00:00:20,050 --> 00:00:25,570
So if I want to get all the articles that have a statistic inside of there I can select.

8
00:00:25,690 --> 00:00:27,640
So document query selector.

9
00:00:28,780 --> 00:00:34,930
I'd left a summary that's going to give me essentially the entire left side, and then I can find all

10
00:00:34,930 --> 00:00:38,380
of the elements inside there with a class of notification.

11
00:00:38,980 --> 00:00:45,040
So I'll do inside of that a query selector of dot notification.

12
00:00:46,740 --> 00:00:47,940
I don't want to do a query selector.

13
00:00:47,940 --> 00:00:48,390
My mistake.

14
00:00:48,390 --> 00:00:49,760
I won't do a query selector.

15
00:00:49,770 --> 00:00:51,300
All that will give me all of them.

16
00:00:51,810 --> 00:00:52,470
So there we go.

17
00:00:52,470 --> 00:00:53,650
There's my list of five.

18
00:00:53,670 --> 00:00:55,740
I've got all five on the left hand side.

19
00:00:56,570 --> 00:00:59,480
Just to be clear, we don't actually have to run the two separate query selectors.

20
00:00:59,480 --> 00:01:01,370
We could actually reduce that down to just one.

21
00:01:01,370 --> 00:01:10,430
So I could do document query selector all and then say inside of the left summary element, find all

22
00:01:10,430 --> 00:01:12,320
the elements with notification.

23
00:01:14,050 --> 00:01:16,660
And that will still give me all five on the left hand side.

24
00:01:17,140 --> 00:01:20,680
So that's how we're going to make sure that we get all five on the left and all five on the right.

25
00:01:21,570 --> 00:01:21,670
Okay.

26
00:01:21,790 --> 00:01:26,950
So back over here inside of run comparison, we're going to get all the elements on the left and right.

27
00:01:26,950 --> 00:01:30,910
I'll say, how about left side stats?

28
00:01:31,700 --> 00:01:34,580
So that's like the statistics being rendered out on the left hand side.

29
00:01:35,590 --> 00:01:38,110
Will be document query selector.

30
00:01:39,290 --> 00:01:39,950
Paul.

31
00:01:40,520 --> 00:01:42,950
And then we want ID.

32
00:01:43,010 --> 00:01:44,330
Left side.

33
00:01:44,330 --> 00:01:44,950
What would we call it?

34
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:45,830
Left or left?

35
00:01:45,830 --> 00:01:46,130
Summary.

36
00:01:46,160 --> 00:01:46,850
My mistake.

37
00:01:48,210 --> 00:01:49,740
Dot notification.

38
00:01:51,740 --> 00:01:58,370
Then we can do the same thing for right side stats and that will be document query selector all.

39
00:01:59,010 --> 00:01:59,700
Right.

40
00:01:59,700 --> 00:02:00,990
Dash summary.

41
00:02:02,940 --> 00:02:04,620
Dot notification.

42
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:09,960
All right.

43
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:18,420
So now we can loop over either one of these and at each step we can take the corresponding element from

44
00:02:18,420 --> 00:02:21,390
the other pair or essentially like the right hand side.

45
00:02:21,390 --> 00:02:25,200
And we can do our comparison by retrieving the data set values.

46
00:02:25,770 --> 00:02:30,270
So I'm going to try to iterate over each element inside of left side stats.

47
00:02:30,270 --> 00:02:34,110
So I'm going to do a left side stats for each.

48
00:02:35,690 --> 00:02:38,600
So I'm going to get my callback function right here.

49
00:02:38,900 --> 00:02:41,300
I'm going to receive each article element.

50
00:02:41,330 --> 00:02:43,040
I will call them left stat.

51
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:48,110
So again, that represents an article element that is going to have that data set value that we really

52
00:02:48,110 --> 00:02:48,890
care about.

53
00:02:48,920 --> 00:02:53,300
And I'm also going to get the index of that element inside of left side stats as well.

54
00:02:53,330 --> 00:02:58,160
The reason I'm getting the index right there is that I can retrieve the appropriate corresponding stat

55
00:02:58,160 --> 00:02:59,780
from right side stats.

56
00:03:00,140 --> 00:03:01,670
So I'll say right.

57
00:03:02,180 --> 00:03:03,650
Stat is.

58
00:03:04,910 --> 00:03:07,910
Right side stats at index.

59
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:11,960
And then again, just to make sure we're doing everything correctly here, I'll do a console log of

60
00:03:11,960 --> 00:03:14,720
left stat and write stat.

61
00:03:17,060 --> 00:03:18,110
That's all safe.

62
00:03:18,620 --> 00:03:19,450
Go back over.

63
00:03:19,460 --> 00:03:20,600
Do the refresh.

64
00:03:22,540 --> 00:03:24,370
I'll look for Avengers.

65
00:03:26,190 --> 00:03:27,180
Dark Knight.

66
00:03:28,710 --> 00:03:29,390
And there we go.

67
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:30,750
We've got our console logs.

68
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:36,710
So we can see that each of these console.log pairs are the two corresponding article elements that go

69
00:03:36,710 --> 00:03:37,220
with each other.

70
00:03:37,220 --> 00:03:38,510
So like that one and that one.

71
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:40,040
And then the box office.

72
00:03:40,040 --> 00:03:40,970
Box office.

73
00:03:41,150 --> 00:03:41,750
Metascore.

74
00:03:41,750 --> 00:03:42,620
Metascore.

75
00:03:42,650 --> 00:03:44,510
IMDB rating and so on.

76
00:03:45,270 --> 00:03:50,970
So then inside of here, we're going to do first get the actual value property off of each of these.

77
00:03:51,330 --> 00:03:55,830
So I'm going to say left side value is going to be left stat.

78
00:03:55,830 --> 00:04:01,830
And to get a data set property, remember we referred to data set and then the name of that data property

79
00:04:01,830 --> 00:04:02,880
on that element.

80
00:04:02,910 --> 00:04:05,910
So in our case, we call the data properties value.

81
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:08,700
So we would reference that value property.

82
00:04:10,330 --> 00:04:12,670
With data set value.

83
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:15,090
And then we can get the right hand side.

84
00:04:15,090 --> 00:04:23,040
With the right side, value is the right side or the right statcast data set value as well.

85
00:04:23,950 --> 00:04:27,040
So now inside of here, we can do our comparison directly between the two.

86
00:04:27,070 --> 00:04:32,740
Again, take note that this comparison process right here, because we assign the stats up front inside

87
00:04:32,740 --> 00:04:37,150
of our movie template, we don't care about the order in which these different stats occur.

88
00:04:37,180 --> 00:04:39,140
They can occur in any different order.

89
00:04:39,160 --> 00:04:44,320
We can have the box office value, then the rating, then the METASCORE or the totally opposite, and

90
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:45,330
it just doesn't matter.

91
00:04:45,340 --> 00:04:50,800
All we have to do is make sure that we are iterating through the same properties on both sides at the

92
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:51,310
same time.

93
00:04:51,310 --> 00:04:57,440
So in other words, we could not show like first awards over here and then first box office over here.

94
00:04:57,460 --> 00:04:59,200
That's the only thing that we could not do.

95
00:05:00,770 --> 00:05:08,810
So inside of here, I'll say if right side value is greater than left side value, that means the right

96
00:05:08,810 --> 00:05:09,590
side is greater.

97
00:05:09,590 --> 00:05:15,800
And that means that we want to add a class to the left hand side that's going to turn it yellow instead

98
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:16,970
of the default green.

99
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:22,760
So to make sure that we turn the left side yellow, we would run left stat which remember is the actual

100
00:05:22,760 --> 00:05:23,780
article element.

101
00:05:24,440 --> 00:05:26,330
I'm going to look at the class list.

102
00:05:27,020 --> 00:05:31,600
I'm going to remove the is primary, which is what makes it green.

103
00:05:31,610 --> 00:05:34,430
Again, this is some class names coming from Boma CSS.

104
00:05:36,860 --> 00:05:42,710
And then on the left stat class list, I will add in is dash warning.

105
00:05:43,870 --> 00:05:45,370
And that's what's going to turn it yellow.

106
00:05:45,970 --> 00:05:48,850
So now we can repeat the same process for the opposite case as well.

107
00:05:48,850 --> 00:05:50,050
So I'll say else.

108
00:05:50,590 --> 00:05:51,040
Right.

109
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:54,610
Stat class list remove is primary.

110
00:05:55,840 --> 00:06:01,240
And it writes that class list ad is warning.

111
00:06:02,830 --> 00:06:04,630
All right, so that should be it.

112
00:06:04,930 --> 00:06:05,680
So here it is.

113
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:07,090
This is our moment of truth.

114
00:06:07,090 --> 00:06:10,200
This should be like the entire application all put together.

115
00:06:10,210 --> 00:06:11,650
Let's do our final test.

116
00:06:12,710 --> 00:06:14,930
So I will do a refresh.

117
00:06:15,140 --> 00:06:16,880
I'm going to look for Avengers.

118
00:06:17,810 --> 00:06:19,110
We'll look for Dark Knight.

119
00:06:21,390 --> 00:06:22,200
There we go.

120
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:23,460
And.

121
00:06:23,460 --> 00:06:24,420
All right.

122
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:25,590
That is it.

123
00:06:25,590 --> 00:06:27,080
And it's looking pretty good.

124
00:06:27,090 --> 00:06:28,890
So we can look through all these different stats.

125
00:06:28,890 --> 00:06:32,910
And we should see that the stats that are in green are greater than the ones in yellow.

126
00:06:33,210 --> 00:06:37,470
So first off, we've got like 118 wins versus the like 300 and change.

127
00:06:37,470 --> 00:06:39,540
So definitely the correct one is green.

128
00:06:40,260 --> 00:06:44,010
While The Avengers had a higher box office value, so that definitely won out.

129
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:50,340
However, Dark Knight has a better METASCORE, better IMDB rating and more votes as well, so that's

130
00:06:50,340 --> 00:06:51,120
pretty much it.

131
00:06:51,270 --> 00:06:52,980
That is the whole application.

132
00:06:53,610 --> 00:06:55,560
Well, I hope you enjoyed putting this thing together.

133
00:06:55,590 --> 00:06:57,460
Let's take a quick pause right here when we come back.

134
00:06:57,480 --> 00:07:02,370
The next video, we're going to do a quick review on some of the important points around this application.
