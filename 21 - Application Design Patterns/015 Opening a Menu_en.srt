1
00:00:00,650 --> 00:00:04,560
We can now show a list of movie posters and the title of each respective movie.

2
00:00:04,580 --> 00:00:09,200
So now all we really have to do, believe it or not, is kind of work on the styling a little bit.

3
00:00:09,500 --> 00:00:13,580
In particular, we need to make sure that all these images are small, that they show up next to their

4
00:00:13,580 --> 00:00:19,520
titles, and that they all appear in a kind of menu directly underneath that little input right there.

5
00:00:20,060 --> 00:00:24,800
So to do so, we're going to use some CSS that is included inside of this project.

6
00:00:24,980 --> 00:00:30,020
Remember, at the very start of this section, we downloaded a boiler plate project wired up inside.

7
00:00:30,020 --> 00:00:33,710
This project is a CSS framework called Boma CSS.

8
00:00:34,430 --> 00:00:40,100
Oma CSS has a collection of different CSS rules that allow you to very quickly style an application.

9
00:00:40,550 --> 00:00:45,590
We're going to take a look at a component or essentially a set of CSS rules that are going to allow

10
00:00:45,590 --> 00:00:50,720
us to very quickly turn the content that we have right here into what we're really looking for.

11
00:00:51,380 --> 00:00:54,980
So I'm going to open up a new browser tab and navigate to this documentation.

12
00:00:57,220 --> 00:00:57,520
Okay.

13
00:00:57,520 --> 00:01:02,380
So if we go down on the left hand side just a little bit, we'll see a demo of what they call a dropdown.

14
00:01:02,770 --> 00:01:06,100
Now, you might look at this and say, Stephen, we're not making a dropdown.

15
00:01:06,100 --> 00:01:08,110
We're making kind of an autocomplete thing.

16
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:09,490
Yes, that's correct.

17
00:01:09,490 --> 00:01:15,670
But we can kind of use some of the CSS that's been implemented to make this dropdown to kind of leverage

18
00:01:15,670 --> 00:01:17,410
it for what we are trying to create.

19
00:01:17,740 --> 00:01:22,780
So the only effective difference between what you see right here and what we are trying to make is the

20
00:01:22,780 --> 00:01:26,380
fact that we want to show a text input right there instead of a button.

21
00:01:27,350 --> 00:01:28,090
They have a button.

22
00:01:28,100 --> 00:01:33,770
We just want to have a text input so we can very easily swap that out to get something like what you

23
00:01:33,770 --> 00:01:34,450
see right here.

24
00:01:34,460 --> 00:01:38,990
All we really have to do is replicate the HTML structure that they have over here on the right hand

25
00:01:38,990 --> 00:01:39,560
side.

26
00:01:40,100 --> 00:01:44,360
Now, I'm not going to ask you to like read over all that CSS and memorize it instead.

27
00:01:44,360 --> 00:01:46,100
Let's go back over to our project.

28
00:01:46,100 --> 00:01:51,290
We're going to write in some of the CSS that you see right here directly to our HTML file, and I'll

29
00:01:51,290 --> 00:01:55,790
show you how quickly and easily we can replicate something that looks like that.

30
00:01:56,700 --> 00:01:57,020
Okay.

31
00:01:57,030 --> 00:01:57,930
So back over.

32
00:01:59,430 --> 00:02:02,040
I'm going to find my index.html file.

33
00:02:02,730 --> 00:02:04,290
I'm going to go down to the very bottom.

34
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:07,550
And I'm going to find my input element.

35
00:02:08,250 --> 00:02:09,780
Right above that input element.

36
00:02:09,810 --> 00:02:11,490
I'm going to add in a new div.

37
00:02:14,250 --> 00:02:19,260
With a class of dropdown and is dash active.

38
00:02:20,030 --> 00:02:23,000
I'm going to put the closing div on the other side of the input.

39
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:26,030
So this div right here is going to wrap our input element.

40
00:02:27,780 --> 00:02:33,360
Then immediately after that I'm going to create another div with a class of dropdown menu.

41
00:02:34,870 --> 00:02:35,920
I'll close it off.

42
00:02:36,620 --> 00:02:37,190
Inside of there.

43
00:02:37,190 --> 00:02:41,420
I'm going to create another diff with the class of dropdown dash content.

44
00:02:42,510 --> 00:02:43,530
Close that one off.

45
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:46,590
And then finally I'm going to make a couple of anchor tags.

46
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:51,780
So an anchor tag like so with a class of dropdown item.

47
00:02:52,750 --> 00:02:58,000
I'll then close off the anchor tag and inside the anchor tag I'll put in movie number one.

48
00:02:59,510 --> 00:03:04,400
And then I'm going to copy paste that anchor tag twice like so and just update the text.

49
00:03:05,140 --> 00:03:10,570
So all I'm doing here is using the same HTML that we just saw inside the Bouma documentation by using

50
00:03:10,570 --> 00:03:15,460
the same HTML, the same class names, all the Boma CSS rules that are included inside this project

51
00:03:15,460 --> 00:03:20,200
are going to kick, in effect and try to style this block of HTML right here.

52
00:03:20,350 --> 00:03:25,150
So even though we are not trying to create a dropdown per se, we can still leverage that set of CSS

53
00:03:25,150 --> 00:03:27,340
rules for styling our application.

54
00:03:28,320 --> 00:03:28,530
Yes.

55
00:03:28,530 --> 00:03:29,520
I'm going to save this.

56
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:30,930
I'm going to flip back over.

57
00:03:31,710 --> 00:03:32,520
Refresh.

58
00:03:32,610 --> 00:03:35,670
And now I see at least what kind of looks like a menu right here.

59
00:03:35,670 --> 00:03:36,410
Of sorts.

60
00:03:36,420 --> 00:03:36,810
I know.

61
00:03:36,810 --> 00:03:38,760
It's, like, pushed up against the left hand side.

62
00:03:39,470 --> 00:03:41,630
But it kind of looks like what we're going for.

63
00:03:41,750 --> 00:03:44,780
I've got a list of items I can kind of hover over them.

64
00:03:44,780 --> 00:03:48,860
When I hover over them, I get that nice little pointer cursor thing, like with the hand, with the

65
00:03:48,860 --> 00:03:49,580
little finger.

66
00:03:49,580 --> 00:03:52,280
And so it's very evident to a user that I can click on this.

67
00:03:52,910 --> 00:03:58,160
So all you and I really have to do now is instead of showing these anchor tags that say movie number

68
00:03:58,160 --> 00:04:01,970
one, two and three, we need to just take our movie images.

69
00:04:01,970 --> 00:04:06,080
So like the poster and movie title and stick it into this anchor tag.

70
00:04:06,230 --> 00:04:10,970
And then everything should essentially show up correctly and nicely styled in our application.

71
00:04:12,620 --> 00:04:15,220
So now we understand what our goal is in the short term.

72
00:04:15,230 --> 00:04:20,160
Let's take a quick pause because there is something to kind of think about on how we approach this problem.

73
00:04:20,180 --> 00:04:24,350
So quick pause and we'll discuss a little interesting side topic in the next video.
