1
00:00:00,790 --> 00:00:04,150
Just to make sure it's really clear why this refactor was so significant.

2
00:00:04,150 --> 00:00:08,140
I want to show you how quickly we could change some of the code inside these different options that

3
00:00:08,140 --> 00:00:12,520
we're passing in and get an autocomplete that works with a very different source of data.

4
00:00:12,910 --> 00:00:17,020
So just as a quick example, you don't have to change your code here because I'm going to change my

5
00:00:17,020 --> 00:00:17,650
code right back.

6
00:00:17,650 --> 00:00:19,450
Again, this is a very quick example.

7
00:00:19,480 --> 00:00:23,380
I'm going to go to JSON placeholder type ICLOUD.COM.

8
00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:28,960
This is a fake API that can be used for testing purposes and just generally kind of messing around.

9
00:00:29,410 --> 00:00:33,220
If I scroll down a little bit, I can find a section called Resources.

10
00:00:34,420 --> 00:00:39,130
And inside there is an endpoint that will serve me up a photo's collection.

11
00:00:39,130 --> 00:00:44,260
Inside there is 5000 different photos, so I encourage you not to click that link because it's going

12
00:00:44,260 --> 00:00:47,140
to load up a ton of data and might make your browser hang.

13
00:00:47,170 --> 00:00:51,190
Nonetheless, I'm going to go ahead and do it myself, so if I click on it after a second or so, I

14
00:00:51,190 --> 00:00:57,010
will see that if I make a request to this endpoint, I'll get back an array of objects where each object

15
00:00:57,010 --> 00:00:58,750
represents one photo.

16
00:00:59,080 --> 00:01:02,620
Each photo has a title and a thumbnail URL.

17
00:01:02,950 --> 00:01:08,080
I'm going to try to make a request and get just 50 of these photos inside of my code, and I'm going

18
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:12,640
to try to render each of them into that autocomplete that we just put together.

19
00:01:13,300 --> 00:01:19,150
If I want to only get 50 photos instead of the 5000 that it just fetched, I could add on to the URL

20
00:01:19,330 --> 00:01:25,390
question mark album ID equals one and that will give me only the first 50 photos inside of here.

21
00:01:25,390 --> 00:01:28,510
So if I scroll down, I'll see that I only get 50 photos total.

22
00:01:29,830 --> 00:01:30,100
Okay.

23
00:01:30,100 --> 00:01:35,590
So to change my autocomplete to work with this source of data, instead I would take this URL and again,

24
00:01:35,590 --> 00:01:36,850
you don't have to make these changes.

25
00:01:36,850 --> 00:01:38,920
I'm going to change my code back very quickly.

26
00:01:38,920 --> 00:01:40,780
This is just a fast demonstration.

27
00:01:40,930 --> 00:01:47,110
I would then go and update my fetch data function, so instead of making a request to the IMDB API,

28
00:01:47,110 --> 00:01:49,960
I'm going to instead just paste that URL in directly.

29
00:01:50,500 --> 00:01:53,470
So slash photos album id equals one.

30
00:01:54,100 --> 00:01:58,450
These params are technically not going to be used, but I can still just leave them in here.

31
00:01:58,480 --> 00:01:59,980
The request is still going to work.

32
00:01:59,980 --> 00:02:00,730
Actually, I'll take them out.

33
00:02:00,730 --> 00:02:01,660
Just be sure.

34
00:02:01,690 --> 00:02:02,980
Just to make sure it's really clear.

35
00:02:03,750 --> 00:02:04,920
So I'll take those out.

36
00:02:05,310 --> 00:02:09,690
I'll then make sure that when I get the response there is no longer a search property.

37
00:02:09,690 --> 00:02:12,000
So I'll take out the dot search.

38
00:02:12,910 --> 00:02:15,460
So this should work correctly to fetch the data.

39
00:02:15,490 --> 00:02:20,890
Now, all we would have to do is make sure that we update how each of these gets rendered that is controlled

40
00:02:20,890 --> 00:02:22,690
inside of render option right here.

41
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:25,330
So instead of the current code I have.

42
00:02:26,220 --> 00:02:29,130
I would instead say, maybe just return.

43
00:02:32,190 --> 00:02:35,070
An image element with the source of.

44
00:02:37,020 --> 00:02:42,510
Movie Dot and let me double check the name of the actual image thumbnail URL.

45
00:02:45,310 --> 00:02:47,980
And then I'll do the title, which is title.

46
00:02:48,980 --> 00:02:50,990
So movie title.

47
00:02:54,540 --> 00:02:56,760
Notice I'm still calling this argument movie.

48
00:02:56,760 --> 00:03:01,710
It now technically is like an image object, but it's just not a good use of time to change the variable

49
00:03:01,710 --> 00:03:02,190
name.

50
00:03:02,910 --> 00:03:03,160
Okay.

51
00:03:03,180 --> 00:03:04,410
So now I can save this.

52
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:06,780
Flip back over, refresh.

53
00:03:06,810 --> 00:03:08,930
And now I should be able to just type anything inside of here.

54
00:03:08,940 --> 00:03:13,260
Technically, there's no longer any searching operation going on, and I'll see this very different

55
00:03:13,260 --> 00:03:14,700
source of data being used.

56
00:03:15,030 --> 00:03:19,890
So now I've got each thumbnail, which is the colored squares you see along with the title of each image

57
00:03:19,890 --> 00:03:21,000
showing up next to it.

58
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:24,600
And I've got all 50 being rendered out right now, so that's pretty much it.

59
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:28,410
That's all we would have to do to make a significant change to the autocomplete.

60
00:03:28,410 --> 00:03:32,880
We just go back to these functions that we understand exactly what they do perfectly.

61
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:37,080
You know, this one fetches data, this one controls how each option gets rendered, make those various

62
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:38,400
few changes, and that's it.

63
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:41,850
We now have a widget that works in a totally different context.

64
00:03:42,620 --> 00:03:42,860
Okay.

65
00:03:42,860 --> 00:03:44,710
So that's just all I want to show you.

66
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:50,690
I'm going to very quickly undo the changes I just made and go back to working with movies and there

67
00:03:50,690 --> 00:03:51,250
we go.

68
00:03:51,260 --> 00:03:55,430
So now I'll do a quick test just to make sure I'm back and still works with movies.

69
00:03:56,300 --> 00:03:56,540
Cool.

70
00:03:56,570 --> 00:03:59,990
So again, just a quick examination of how you would change things out.

71
00:03:59,990 --> 00:04:01,250
So let's take another pause here.

72
00:04:01,250 --> 00:04:02,930
