1
00:00:01,070 --> 00:00:04,880
All right, let's keep writing out some HTML to show all the stats underneath this movie.

2
00:00:05,300 --> 00:00:08,720
So back inside my code editor, I'll find the movie template function.

3
00:00:09,080 --> 00:00:13,310
We will go down to the bottom and we're going to add in just a little bit more HTML here.

4
00:00:13,850 --> 00:00:18,080
So after the closing article element, I'm going to place another article.

5
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:21,730
I'm going to give it a class of notification.

6
00:00:22,390 --> 00:00:25,900
And then a space is dash primary.

7
00:00:27,460 --> 00:00:28,870
I then close off the article.

8
00:00:29,840 --> 00:00:32,330
And inside of here, I'll do a paragraph tag.

9
00:00:33,090 --> 00:00:34,440
But the class of title.

10
00:00:35,940 --> 00:00:36,750
Was it off?

11
00:00:37,140 --> 00:00:41,490
And inside there, we're going to reference movie detail about awards.

12
00:00:41,880 --> 00:00:46,390
So this is going to be a string summary of all of the different awards that this movie has won.

13
00:00:46,410 --> 00:00:48,990
We'll see exactly what it looks like in the dorm in just a second.

14
00:00:49,620 --> 00:00:54,210
After that, I'm going to put in essentially a label for this statistic, so I'll do another paragraph

15
00:00:54,210 --> 00:00:56,940
element with the class of subtitle.

16
00:00:58,940 --> 00:01:02,870
And inside of there, I'll say simply awards like so.

17
00:01:04,290 --> 00:01:04,620
Okay.

18
00:01:04,620 --> 00:01:09,660
So this right here, this article element, we're going to essentially duplicate this down several times.

19
00:01:09,660 --> 00:01:14,580
And inside of every duplicated version, we're going to be referencing a different property off of movie

20
00:01:14,580 --> 00:01:17,820
detail and B, giving each of them a different label as well.

21
00:01:18,300 --> 00:01:23,400
So I'm going to take this article element, I'm going to copy it, and then I'm going to copy it down

22
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:24,570
four times.

23
00:01:25,050 --> 00:01:27,600
So here's one to.

24
00:01:28,420 --> 00:01:29,050
Three.

25
00:01:29,670 --> 00:01:34,140
And for now, we'll go through each of these and update some of the different properties.

26
00:01:36,290 --> 00:01:38,270
I'm going to go up, find the first one.

27
00:01:38,480 --> 00:01:44,480
I'll go to the second one and I'm going to change the second one from awards right there to box office.

28
00:01:45,540 --> 00:01:49,440
I'll change the label right underneath it to box office as well.

29
00:01:52,420 --> 00:01:53,910
Next up, we'll go to number three.

30
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:57,160
I'm going to change that one to awards to Metascore.

31
00:01:58,460 --> 00:02:00,470
I'll change the label to Metascore.

32
00:02:00,470 --> 00:02:04,160
So again, this is like a rating essentially of the movie.

33
00:02:05,720 --> 00:02:06,350
The next one.

34
00:02:06,350 --> 00:02:09,310
So second to last one IMDB rating.

35
00:02:09,320 --> 00:02:14,030
Notice how in this case I has a lowercase as opposed to all the other property names that start with

36
00:02:14,030 --> 00:02:14,780
the capital.

37
00:02:15,650 --> 00:02:18,950
The label will be IMDB rating.

38
00:02:18,950 --> 00:02:22,190
So this is the rating of the movie according to the website IMDB.

39
00:02:24,150 --> 00:02:28,440
And then finally on the last one, we'll change it to IMDB votes.

40
00:02:29,090 --> 00:02:31,520
And IMDB.

41
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:33,470
Boats.

42
00:02:33,590 --> 00:02:39,110
So that's the number of votes that this movie has gotten on IMDB by different users of that platform.

43
00:02:40,470 --> 00:02:40,600
Okay.

44
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:41,510
So that's pretty much it.

45
00:02:41,510 --> 00:02:42,350
Let's save this.

46
00:02:42,350 --> 00:02:44,140
We've got five different properties here.

47
00:02:44,150 --> 00:02:48,890
Like I said, a couple added beyond just the two that we had mentioned over here back in our original

48
00:02:48,890 --> 00:02:49,490
mockup.

49
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:51,200
So I'll save that file.

50
00:02:51,230 --> 00:02:52,430
I will refresh.

51
00:02:52,970 --> 00:02:54,710
I'll look for Avengers.

52
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:57,690
Look at and there we go.

53
00:02:57,730 --> 00:02:59,270
So now I see The Avengers.

54
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:06,240
I see the awards that this movie has won box office, take the METASCORE, the rating on IMDB, and

55
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:09,330
the number of votes that the movie has gotten on IMDB as well.

56
00:03:09,930 --> 00:03:10,800
That's pretty much it.

57
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:12,930
That's like stage one of our application.

58
00:03:12,930 --> 00:03:15,810
We now have the ability to search for a movie.

59
00:03:15,810 --> 00:03:17,940
We've got some autocomplete functionality in there.

60
00:03:17,940 --> 00:03:22,320
Once a user selects a movie, we show a lot of information about it on the screen.

61
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:26,110
So now we essentially just have to do a lot of duplicate work.

62
00:03:26,130 --> 00:03:31,620
We essentially need to duplicate everything we just did and show a second auto complete on the right

63
00:03:31,620 --> 00:03:32,760
hand side of the screen.

64
00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:37,820
And then once we have all the same functionality for that autocomplete, we'll then just need to make

65
00:03:37,820 --> 00:03:43,190
sure that when we search for two different movies, we compare all the different statistics and highlight

66
00:03:43,190 --> 00:03:45,260
the higher ones in each category.

67
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:47,610
Yes.

68
00:03:47,610 --> 00:03:49,000
That's some pretty good progress.

69
00:03:49,020 --> 00:03:52,710
Let's take a pause right here and start on this next phase in the next video.
