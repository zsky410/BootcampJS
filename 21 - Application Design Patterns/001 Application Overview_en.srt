1
00:00:00,940 --> 00:00:04,120
In this video, we're going to discuss the first application we're going to build.

2
00:00:04,150 --> 00:00:07,820
The goal of this application is to practice your JavaScript skill set.

3
00:00:07,840 --> 00:00:10,910
We're not going to be covering a lot of new features of the language.

4
00:00:10,930 --> 00:00:15,520
Instead, we're going to be focusing on a lot of the stuff that we've already learned and really practicing

5
00:00:15,520 --> 00:00:16,480
our skill set.

6
00:00:16,990 --> 00:00:21,760
Let's take a look at some mock ups to help you get an idea of what we're going to try to build.

7
00:00:22,210 --> 00:00:25,180
So we're going to be making an application called Movie Fight.

8
00:00:25,450 --> 00:00:31,090
The idea here is that a user is going to search for a movie on the left hand side of the screen and

9
00:00:31,090 --> 00:00:33,580
a different one on the right hand side of the screen.

10
00:00:34,210 --> 00:00:39,970
So a user is going to type in some movie title and then once they search for it, we're going to fetch

11
00:00:39,970 --> 00:00:44,950
some information about that movie and show information about it on the left hand side of the screen.

12
00:00:45,160 --> 00:00:48,280
So in this case, a user might have searched for Dark Knight.

13
00:00:48,280 --> 00:00:52,210
And so I would pull up some information about the movie The Dark Knight.

14
00:00:52,970 --> 00:00:58,760
This little box right here with an X represents the image or the movie poster for The Dark Knight movie.

15
00:00:58,790 --> 00:01:03,290
So we're going to show the poster for the movie right there and then some stats about the movie underneath

16
00:01:03,290 --> 00:01:03,710
it.

17
00:01:03,740 --> 00:01:08,630
So, for example, how much money it made and its critical, critical rating and so on.

18
00:01:09,320 --> 00:01:13,610
Once a user searches for a movie on the left hand side, they're then going to repeat that same process

19
00:01:13,610 --> 00:01:15,110
on the right hand side.

20
00:01:15,560 --> 00:01:20,930
So we can imagine that a user might type in a different movie over here like The Avengers, and we will

21
00:01:20,930 --> 00:01:25,250
show some information about The Avengers in a very similar fashion on the right hand side.

22
00:01:25,850 --> 00:01:30,350
Now, here's what makes this application an actual like movie fight application.

23
00:01:30,680 --> 00:01:35,510
For every different stat that we fetch about every different movie, we're going to compare them between

24
00:01:35,510 --> 00:01:36,170
the two.

25
00:01:37,060 --> 00:01:42,250
Whichever movie has a higher statistic we're going to highlight in Green, in whichever movie has the

26
00:01:42,250 --> 00:01:44,350
lower statistic we're going to show in yellow.

27
00:01:44,500 --> 00:01:49,780
So in this case, The Avengers made a lot more money at the box office than The Dark Knight.

28
00:01:49,780 --> 00:01:55,120
So we would color that statistic as green and we would color the Dark Knight statistic as yellow.

29
00:01:55,720 --> 00:02:00,370
However, the Dark Knight might have a higher critic rating, so we'll show that as Green and The Avengers

30
00:02:00,370 --> 00:02:02,200
one will be displayed as yellow instead.

31
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:04,910
So that's the application.

32
00:02:04,930 --> 00:02:09,190
There is one last thing I want to mention here, kind of a very specific thing, because we actually

33
00:02:09,190 --> 00:02:13,900
are going to be spending a pretty good amount of time on this when a user searches for a movie.

34
00:02:14,890 --> 00:02:20,140
Like in these two inputs right here, a user might not know exactly what movie they're looking for.

35
00:02:20,170 --> 00:02:24,820
They might have some kind of idea of what the title is, but they might only be able to remember that

36
00:02:24,820 --> 00:02:28,630
like has dark in the title if they are trying to find Dark Knight.

37
00:02:29,050 --> 00:02:33,070
So these two inputs right here are not going to be normal inputs.

38
00:02:33,100 --> 00:02:37,030
Instead, we're going to make them into kind of autocomplete inputs.

39
00:02:37,510 --> 00:02:42,310
So whenever a user types in something like Just Dark or even Dark Knight, we're going to have a little

40
00:02:42,310 --> 00:02:48,100
pop up listing right here that shows a couple of different movies related to the search term that they

41
00:02:48,100 --> 00:02:48,910
just entered.

42
00:02:49,270 --> 00:02:54,100
So to actually select a movie and start the comparison, a user would have to click on that entry right

43
00:02:54,100 --> 00:02:58,840
there, and that would select The Dark Knight that was made in the year 2008.

44
00:02:59,660 --> 00:03:01,760
On the left hand side of each of these movie titles.

45
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:05,090
We're also going to show the poster for the movie as well.

46
00:03:06,070 --> 00:03:10,780
This is going to be a separate little autocomplete widget that we put together as a part of this project.

47
00:03:10,900 --> 00:03:14,860
We're going to build that autocomplete widget from scratch, and as a matter of fact, everything you

48
00:03:14,860 --> 00:03:17,760
see in this application is really going to be from scratch.

49
00:03:17,770 --> 00:03:23,080
So we're going to get a really good idea of how to approach this app, how to build it, and eventually

50
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:24,280
we're going to deploy it.

51
00:03:25,900 --> 00:03:26,170
Okay.

52
00:03:26,170 --> 00:03:28,360
So I hope you're as excited as I am.

53
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:30,010
This is going to be a really fun application.

54
00:03:30,010 --> 00:03:33,640
So let's take a quick pause right here and start working in the next video.
