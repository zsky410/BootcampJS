1
00:00:01,200 --> 00:00:04,560
All right, now that we've got all these statistics, let's make sure that we add each of them to the

2
00:00:04,560 --> 00:00:07,260
appropriate article elements inside of our template.

3
00:00:07,830 --> 00:00:13,320
So down here I have my first article right there that is meant to show the number of awards.

4
00:00:13,590 --> 00:00:20,970
So on that article element, I'm going to add in a data value property and I'm going to inject the value

5
00:00:21,090 --> 00:00:22,320
awards to it.

6
00:00:23,250 --> 00:00:26,130
And we can repeat that same process for the other articles as well.

7
00:00:26,490 --> 00:00:29,070
So the next one is supposed to show box office.

8
00:00:29,070 --> 00:00:32,229
I think we called the relevant statistic dollars.

9
00:00:32,250 --> 00:00:33,360
Yeah, there it is right there.

10
00:00:33,900 --> 00:00:35,400
So I'm going to go back down.

11
00:00:35,700 --> 00:00:37,980
There is the box office statistic on the article.

12
00:00:37,980 --> 00:00:39,330
I'll do a data value.

13
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:41,400
Of dollars.

14
00:00:42,340 --> 00:00:47,140
The next one is a data value of metascore.

15
00:00:48,870 --> 00:00:50,790
And we've got our IMDB rating.

16
00:00:51,550 --> 00:00:55,960
So data value of IMDB rating.

17
00:00:56,350 --> 00:00:58,510
And then finally, data value.

18
00:00:59,270 --> 00:01:01,220
IMDB votes.

19
00:01:02,180 --> 00:01:03,320
And that should be it.

20
00:01:05,090 --> 00:01:07,460
As usual, we'll do a quick save and a test.

21
00:01:07,790 --> 00:01:12,890
So the test in this case is to inspect our DOM elements and just make sure that we are assigning some

22
00:01:12,890 --> 00:01:14,330
reasonable values to each one.

23
00:01:14,750 --> 00:01:16,040
So I will refresh.

24
00:01:16,730 --> 00:01:18,110
I'll look up Avengers.

25
00:01:18,590 --> 00:01:19,070
Whoops.

26
00:01:19,220 --> 00:01:21,990
I accidentally typed dollar instead of dollars.

27
00:01:22,010 --> 00:01:22,730
My mistake.

28
00:01:23,300 --> 00:01:23,930
There we go.

29
00:01:23,960 --> 00:01:25,190
Dollars on the second one.

30
00:01:27,760 --> 00:01:29,040
Avengers again.

31
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:30,100
I like it.

32
00:01:30,100 --> 00:01:30,860
That's better.

33
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:32,760
So now I can inspect my Dom.

34
00:01:32,770 --> 00:01:36,580
I'm going to look at each of these elements and just make sure that they have the appropriate value

35
00:01:36,580 --> 00:01:37,270
property.

36
00:01:38,230 --> 00:01:38,950
And there we go.

37
00:01:38,950 --> 00:01:40,600
So I can see the list of articles.

38
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:41,440
There's the first one.

39
00:01:41,440 --> 00:01:43,330
It has a data value of 118.

40
00:01:43,660 --> 00:01:49,810
Then I've got the number value for the dollars, then the METASCORE, the IMDB rating, and finally

41
00:01:49,810 --> 00:01:50,950
the number of votes.

42
00:01:52,050 --> 00:01:53,070
So that's pretty much it.

43
00:01:53,190 --> 00:01:57,220
We can now repeat that same process for this stuff on the right hand side as well.

44
00:01:57,240 --> 00:01:59,010
So over here I'll look up Dark Knight.

45
00:02:00,690 --> 00:02:03,000
I'll do an inspect of that element right there.

46
00:02:04,330 --> 00:02:06,820
And I get 309 awards.

47
00:02:06,820 --> 00:02:07,990
Wow, that's pretty crazy.

48
00:02:08,320 --> 00:02:15,640
Then I get the about 533 million, then 84 METASCORE and nine IMDB rating.

49
00:02:15,640 --> 00:02:17,830
And finally, 2 million votes.

50
00:02:19,330 --> 00:02:19,620
Okay.

51
00:02:19,690 --> 00:02:20,560
So that's it.

52
00:02:21,070 --> 00:02:26,720
Now, the very last thing we have to do inside of our compare run comparison function right here.

53
00:02:26,740 --> 00:02:30,040
We can now iterate over all those different article elements.

54
00:02:30,040 --> 00:02:32,350
So we're going to iterate over both them at the same time.

55
00:02:32,350 --> 00:02:37,180
Basically, basically get this collection on the left hand side and this collection on the right hand

56
00:02:37,180 --> 00:02:43,240
side, and then we'll compare each of them one by one by looking at their data value properties, whichever

57
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:43,900
one is greater.

58
00:02:43,900 --> 00:02:47,110
We're going to apply some classes to to colored as yellow.

59
00:02:47,110 --> 00:02:50,110
Otherwise we'll leave it as is and just leave it green.

60
00:02:50,970 --> 00:02:52,020
It's that's the idea.

61
00:02:52,050 --> 00:02:54,960
One more quick pause and we're going to wrap this thing up in the next video.
