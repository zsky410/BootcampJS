1
00:00:01,150 --> 00:00:01,540
All right.

2
00:00:01,540 --> 00:00:06,340
Now that we've got this better HTML structure, we're going to go back over to our indexed JS file and

3
00:00:06,340 --> 00:00:11,860
make sure that we show two separate auto completes, one that's going to use left autocomplete as a

4
00:00:11,860 --> 00:00:15,160
root, the other is going to use write autocomplete as a root.

5
00:00:15,520 --> 00:00:21,520
So back inside of my indexed JS file at the very top we are calling Create Autocomplete and we're passing

6
00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:26,110
in a reference to a div with a class of autocomplete which doesn't exist anymore.

7
00:00:26,410 --> 00:00:30,220
So I'm going to change that query selector to LB Right.

8
00:00:30,220 --> 00:00:33,820
Dash actually, let's do left first left dash autocomplete.

9
00:00:34,030 --> 00:00:35,290
I'll go ahead and save this.

10
00:00:35,800 --> 00:00:41,110
So now if we flip back over and refresh, we see one autocomplete on the left hand side.

11
00:00:41,110 --> 00:00:45,970
So now we need to essentially do the exact same thing to create the autocomplete on the right hand side

12
00:00:45,970 --> 00:00:46,720
as well.

13
00:00:47,290 --> 00:00:51,430
So you might be thinking that that means that we essentially have to duplicate all of this code right

14
00:00:51,430 --> 00:00:56,980
here just to have a second call to create autocomplete with a different route.

15
00:00:57,280 --> 00:01:00,700
We don't have to we don't have to duplicate all of this config.

16
00:01:00,700 --> 00:01:02,260
So let me show you what we're going to do.

17
00:01:03,340 --> 00:01:10,060
At the very top of the file, I'm going to create a new variable called auto complete config.

18
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:16,950
And I'll make it an object and we're going to go into our current autocomplete config.

19
00:01:16,950 --> 00:01:21,330
So like this object right here and we're going to take out every option inside of here.

20
00:01:21,330 --> 00:01:26,580
So every key value property, every function that is reusable between our two different auto completes,

21
00:01:26,590 --> 00:01:27,570
we want to show.

22
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:35,340
Well, if we look through here, every single function inside is reusable except for the root element.

23
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:39,330
Maybe that maybe we'll go down the line and realize that it's not 100% reusable.

24
00:01:39,330 --> 00:01:44,070
But for right now, I think that we definitely can reuse just about everything except for that root

25
00:01:44,070 --> 00:01:44,700
element.

26
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:47,220
So I'm going to take render option.

27
00:01:48,470 --> 00:01:50,970
I'll go down to the bottom of fetch data.

28
00:01:50,990 --> 00:01:52,430
I'm going to highlight all that.

29
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:54,800
I'm going to cut all of it.

30
00:01:55,190 --> 00:01:56,990
So now the only thing that's left is root.

31
00:01:57,340 --> 00:02:00,650
I'm going to paste all of it inside of autocomplete config.

32
00:02:01,870 --> 00:02:02,530
Like so.

33
00:02:05,370 --> 00:02:09,270
So now inside of the create autocomplete function call right here.

34
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:16,160
We're going to essentially say create a new object, take all of the properties inside of autocomplete

35
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:21,620
config that we defined at the top of the file and then add in this new property of root and then take

36
00:02:21,620 --> 00:02:24,080
that whole object and pass it off to create autocomplete.

37
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:28,130
So to do so, we're going to write out inside of here, dot, dot, dot.

38
00:02:29,380 --> 00:02:32,740
Auto completes config and then a comma.

39
00:02:33,370 --> 00:02:38,260
So the dot, dot, dot right there means make a copy of everything inside that object or essentially

40
00:02:38,260 --> 00:02:44,560
take all the different functions inside there and throw them into this object and then add in this root

41
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:45,580
property as well.

42
00:02:45,580 --> 00:02:46,680
And that's it.

43
00:02:46,690 --> 00:02:50,560
So what we have right here is 100% equivalent to what we had just before.

44
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:56,140
But now, since Autocomplete config is its own separate object, we can repeat this process as many

45
00:02:56,140 --> 00:03:00,760
times as we want and create additional auto completes with the same configuration object.

46
00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:06,530
So to do so, I'm going to make a copy of create autocomplete config or simply create autocomplete just

47
00:03:06,530 --> 00:03:07,430
the function call.

48
00:03:08,460 --> 00:03:09,300
Well, paste it.

49
00:03:09,330 --> 00:03:12,040
Now all we have to do is update the query selector.

50
00:03:12,060 --> 00:03:15,150
So instead of saying left, I'm going to say, Right.

51
00:03:17,940 --> 00:03:18,810
And that's pretty much it.

52
00:03:18,810 --> 00:03:19,950
So I'm going to save this.

53
00:03:20,430 --> 00:03:25,170
I'm going to go back over refresh and now I see the two separate auto completes.

54
00:03:25,620 --> 00:03:27,090
I'm going to make sure I don't have any errors.

55
00:03:27,090 --> 00:03:28,650
Nope, nothing inside my console.

56
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:34,380
Now, if I do a search for Avengers, it looks like the left hand side is working.

57
00:03:34,740 --> 00:03:37,470
And if I do a search for Dark Knight on the right.

58
00:03:37,470 --> 00:03:39,180
Yep, that's working as well.

59
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:42,150
I can click that Avengers click that.

60
00:03:42,150 --> 00:03:42,390
Yep.

61
00:03:42,390 --> 00:03:43,080
Looks good.

62
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:48,180
Now if I click on those, I probably going to see an error down here because we deleted the element

63
00:03:48,180 --> 00:03:49,830
that showed the actual summary.

64
00:03:49,830 --> 00:03:53,070
You're only call just a second ago when we were updating the HTML file.

65
00:03:53,070 --> 00:03:57,660
So I think that the next obvious thing we have to do is make sure that once we search for something,

66
00:03:57,660 --> 00:04:02,670
we need to hide this kind of tutorial element right here and show a summary on just the appropriate

67
00:04:02,670 --> 00:04:03,630
side of the screen.

68
00:04:03,810 --> 00:04:05,940
So let's take care of that process in the next video.
