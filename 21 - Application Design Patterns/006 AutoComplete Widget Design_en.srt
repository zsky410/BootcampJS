1
00:00:01,070 --> 00:00:05,600
We've now got a good understanding of how to make requests to that outside API and get some information

2
00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:06,770
about some different movies.

3
00:00:06,770 --> 00:00:10,610
So we're now going to turn our focus a little bit and start to think about how we're going to put together

4
00:00:10,610 --> 00:00:12,020
that autocomplete widget.

5
00:00:12,170 --> 00:00:17,470
Once we understand the autocomplete will then be able to just about go straight from start to finish

6
00:00:17,480 --> 00:00:19,160
on writing out the code for this project.

7
00:00:19,160 --> 00:00:20,930
So just one last little video here.

8
00:00:22,130 --> 00:00:26,030
I put together a diagram on the behavior of this autocomplete widget.

9
00:00:26,060 --> 00:00:29,710
This is a kind of confusing diagram, so we're going to go through it step by step.

10
00:00:29,720 --> 00:00:34,550
But my intent here is to really clarify exactly how this autocomplete widget is going to work.

11
00:00:34,970 --> 00:00:39,830
Once again, I really recommend that on your own personal projects, you go through a kind of process

12
00:00:39,830 --> 00:00:45,110
like what I'm about to show you to make sure that you personally are 100% aware about the requirements

13
00:00:45,110 --> 00:00:48,440
of the different things that you need to build inside of your application.

14
00:00:48,980 --> 00:00:53,240
Once you start building diagrams like this, or you even have to make a diagram, just to be clear,

15
00:00:53,240 --> 00:00:57,500
once you just start thinking through it, I can just about guarantee you that you're going to very quickly

16
00:00:57,500 --> 00:01:02,840
start to realize there are quarter cases that are a lot easier to solve upfront, as opposed to if you

17
00:01:02,840 --> 00:01:06,800
were just start to write code and then kind of run into some issue along the way.

18
00:01:07,970 --> 00:01:08,100
Okay.

19
00:01:08,270 --> 00:01:12,110
So we're going to start off this diagram on the very top left hand side, and we're going to think about

20
00:01:12,110 --> 00:01:15,470
all the different ways that a user can interact with this widget.

21
00:01:16,490 --> 00:01:20,320
So this is what the widget is going to look like when a user first loads up the page.

22
00:01:20,330 --> 00:01:23,180
We're going to show them just a simple empty input.

23
00:01:23,510 --> 00:01:25,550
We would refer to this as the default state.

24
00:01:25,550 --> 00:01:30,260
In other words, this is what it looks like by default when the application first starts up.

25
00:01:31,070 --> 00:01:34,730
At some point in time, the user is then going to start typing inside that input.

26
00:01:35,090 --> 00:01:38,990
As soon as the user enters in some kind of full string and stops typing.

27
00:01:39,620 --> 00:01:43,760
We're going to take that search string and make a request off to the API.

28
00:01:44,090 --> 00:01:49,070
We're going to do a search request, get back some list of results like we just saw a moment ago.

29
00:01:49,190 --> 00:01:55,040
We're going to take all those search results, open up a little menu underneath that input and render

30
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:58,760
out all the possible movies that the user might have been looking for.

31
00:01:59,210 --> 00:02:02,960
As a quick reminder at these boxes with an X in them represent an image.

32
00:02:03,140 --> 00:02:07,460
So that would be the movie poster for the movie The Dark Knight made in 2012.

33
00:02:09,199 --> 00:02:09,860
Right away.

34
00:02:09,860 --> 00:02:12,450
There is one other case we need to be aware of here.

35
00:02:12,470 --> 00:02:18,380
It is entirely possible that a user user will enter in a search string, will do a search and not find

36
00:02:18,380 --> 00:02:19,940
any results whatsoever.

37
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:25,280
So if we don't find any results, we're just going to say that we're going to close that menu entirely.

38
00:02:25,640 --> 00:02:30,380
It might be a little bit better to show us some kind of error message to the user and tell them, Hey,

39
00:02:30,380 --> 00:02:34,490
sorry, but we couldn't find any movies with that search term, but right now we're not going to worry

40
00:02:34,490 --> 00:02:35,470
about that right away.

41
00:02:35,480 --> 00:02:38,510
So we're going to say if we don't find any results, just hide the menu.

42
00:02:41,170 --> 00:02:45,790
So that's kind of like step one, understanding what happens in the instant that the user starts to

43
00:02:45,790 --> 00:02:46,900
type stuff in.

44
00:02:47,320 --> 00:02:52,510
So now I want to kind of go further along the flow and think about the different ways that a user can

45
00:02:52,540 --> 00:02:53,710
then interact with the widget.

46
00:02:53,710 --> 00:02:59,110
After we show them that menu, the first thing they could do is press enter, thinking that that will

47
00:02:59,110 --> 00:03:01,600
select some kind of record or something like that.

48
00:03:02,020 --> 00:03:06,820
In this case, we're going to require a user to actually click on an element here to select it.

49
00:03:06,820 --> 00:03:12,850
So we want to see a user click on like that movie or that movie or that movie to indicate which one

50
00:03:12,850 --> 00:03:13,930
they want to select.

51
00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:19,780
So we're going to require them to click on a movie and pressing the enter key is not going to do anything.

52
00:03:20,170 --> 00:03:24,340
This is another one of those scenarios where you kind of have to sit down and think these things through

53
00:03:24,370 --> 00:03:28,870
because otherwise you might build the widget and then press the inner key, expecting something to happen

54
00:03:28,870 --> 00:03:31,250
and see that it does nothing and be kind of surprised.

55
00:03:31,270 --> 00:03:36,340
So I'm saying from the get go that I don't want anything to happen if a user presses the enter key.

56
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:41,320
The next possible interaction is that a user does what we want.

57
00:03:41,340 --> 00:03:43,110
They might click on an entry.

58
00:03:43,530 --> 00:03:46,530
So if they click on an entry, that means that they have made their selection.

59
00:03:46,950 --> 00:03:52,980
In that case, we're going to update the text inside of the input to the exact text of the title of

60
00:03:52,980 --> 00:03:54,540
the movie that they just clicked on.

61
00:03:54,930 --> 00:04:01,110
So, for example, if the user had searched for Dark Knight and then they clicked on The Dark Knight

62
00:04:01,110 --> 00:04:05,970
with proper capitalization, we're going to take that full movie title right there, just the title,

63
00:04:05,970 --> 00:04:07,180
not the year it was made.

64
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:09,870
We're just showing the year for convenience sake, for the user.

65
00:04:10,530 --> 00:04:15,450
We're going to take that full title and stick it back into the input so that it's crystal clear exactly

66
00:04:15,450 --> 00:04:17,010
what movie they were looking at.

67
00:04:18,670 --> 00:04:23,260
Now there's one last possible way of interacting with this thing that we need to be aware of after a

68
00:04:23,260 --> 00:04:24,670
user enters a search term.

69
00:04:25,300 --> 00:04:30,760
If they enter a term and we open up that dropdown menu and show them all the options, they might decide

70
00:04:30,760 --> 00:04:32,750
that they don't want to pick any movie.

71
00:04:32,770 --> 00:04:34,510
They might decide, Yeah, I'm kind of done with this.

72
00:04:34,510 --> 00:04:35,590
I don't want to select a movie.

73
00:04:35,590 --> 00:04:38,410
I want to work on some other part of this application or something.

74
00:04:38,920 --> 00:04:43,780
If that's the case and they click outside of the menu after it's been opened, then we're going to make

75
00:04:43,780 --> 00:04:46,510
sure that we close the menu and do nothing else.

76
00:04:46,870 --> 00:04:51,580
So this is one more of those scenarios where we really have to think through the lifecycle of the entire

77
00:04:51,580 --> 00:04:54,880
widget, and it's helpful to do so before we start writing any code.

78
00:04:55,820 --> 00:04:56,060
Okay.

79
00:04:56,090 --> 00:04:56,600
So that's it.

80
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:59,570
That's the entire life cycle of this little autocomplete.

81
00:04:59,570 --> 00:05:02,960
These are all the different scenarios that we really have to be thinking about now.

82
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:07,640
There definitely are one or two kind of other corner cases inside of this widget that we need to be

83
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:13,460
aware of that I kind of purposely did not add into this diagram because I want us to kind of run into

84
00:05:13,460 --> 00:05:17,570
these little mysterious scenarios and point them out as kind of a learning experience.

85
00:05:17,570 --> 00:05:21,440
So we might see one or two unexpected things crop up along the way.

86
00:05:23,310 --> 00:05:23,640
All right.

87
00:05:23,640 --> 00:05:27,360
Now that we understand what we're trying to do here and we understand the interaction with this widget,

88
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:30,630
let's take one more pause and then start writing some code in the next video.
