1
00:00:00,560 --> 00:00:02,870
Our Autocomplete widget is working out pretty well.

2
00:00:02,870 --> 00:00:06,770
So now the last thing I want to do is to actually go back to the original application that we're working

3
00:00:06,770 --> 00:00:07,160
on.

4
00:00:07,400 --> 00:00:11,750
We need to make sure that we essentially have two different auto completes being displayed and they

5
00:00:11,750 --> 00:00:15,170
need to kind of show up next to each other in like two separate columns.

6
00:00:15,530 --> 00:00:20,270
We should also make sure that when the user first loads up the app, we show some kind of tutorial message

7
00:00:20,270 --> 00:00:22,880
on the screen as well and tell them exactly what to do.

8
00:00:23,150 --> 00:00:27,800
So in this video, we're going to change our HTML structure a little bit to make sure that we get these

9
00:00:27,800 --> 00:00:30,350
two different columns and that tutorial message.

10
00:00:30,500 --> 00:00:33,760
So we're going to do a lot of typing inside of our indexed HTML file.

11
00:00:33,770 --> 00:00:35,570
So I'm going to open that up right away.

12
00:00:36,230 --> 00:00:40,490
Once again, a lot of the different classes that we're going to add in here are taken directly from

13
00:00:40,490 --> 00:00:42,230
the Boma CSS library.

14
00:00:42,590 --> 00:00:48,320
We're not going to focus too much on the class names or the styling because again, class about JavaScript

15
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:49,280
that's we're here for.

16
00:00:49,740 --> 00:00:50,750
Okay, so let's get to it.

17
00:00:51,170 --> 00:00:56,180
Inside of here, I'm going to first begin by deleting the two elements we have inside of class container.

18
00:00:56,180 --> 00:00:58,850
So we're going to essentially just rewrite all the structure we have.

19
00:01:00,520 --> 00:01:06,010
Inside of class container and then going to create a class or a div with class of columns.

20
00:01:07,730 --> 00:01:08,450
Inside there.

21
00:01:08,450 --> 00:01:11,690
I'm going to do a div with the class of column.

22
00:01:11,810 --> 00:01:13,290
Notice there's no se on there.

23
00:01:13,310 --> 00:01:14,630
The one before had an se.

24
00:01:14,660 --> 00:01:15,590
This one doesn't.

25
00:01:17,560 --> 00:01:18,550
Inside of this one.

26
00:01:18,550 --> 00:01:23,620
I'm going to show a div with an ID of left dash autocomplete.

27
00:01:23,980 --> 00:01:28,870
So as you would guess, we're going to eventually use this as the root element for the autocomplete

28
00:01:28,870 --> 00:01:29,350
that we're going to show.

29
00:01:29,350 --> 00:01:30,480
On the left hand side.

30
00:01:30,490 --> 00:01:36,580
I'm using a div here just to 100% identify this thing as a very unique element inside of my application,

31
00:01:36,580 --> 00:01:39,340
and I only ever want to have one with that ID.

32
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:41,330
Okay.

33
00:01:41,460 --> 00:01:44,520
I'm going to close off the div with class column right there.

34
00:01:45,150 --> 00:01:48,300
And then after it, I'm going to put another div with the class.

35
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:50,240
Of column.

36
00:01:52,830 --> 00:01:58,860
And inside there I'll do another div with an ID of right dash autocomplete.

37
00:01:59,970 --> 00:02:01,080
And I'll close it off.

38
00:02:02,940 --> 00:02:03,240
Yes.

39
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:04,620
That's a good place to get started.

40
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:10,620
Now, finally, after the div with class columns, the closing element for that or the closing tag is

41
00:02:10,740 --> 00:02:11,550
right there.

42
00:02:11,940 --> 00:02:14,700
So it's going to find the closing tag for the class columns.

43
00:02:14,700 --> 00:02:19,140
And after it, I'm going to put in some markup to show a tutorial of sorts to the user.

44
00:02:19,770 --> 00:02:23,490
So I'm going to do a div with a class couple of class names here.

45
00:02:23,490 --> 00:02:24,660
So we're going to have column.

46
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:27,790
Is dash half.

47
00:02:28,460 --> 00:02:29,660
Notification.

48
00:02:30,510 --> 00:02:31,590
Notification.

49
00:02:31,590 --> 00:02:36,960
There we go is dash primary and tutorial.

50
00:02:38,030 --> 00:02:41,990
I'll close off that div and we're going to show some message to the user inside of here so they understand

51
00:02:41,990 --> 00:02:43,310
how to use our application.

52
00:02:43,460 --> 00:02:45,920
So I'll do an H one with the class of title.

53
00:02:47,380 --> 00:02:52,660
And I'll say something like Search for a movie on both sides.

54
00:02:53,380 --> 00:02:57,650
And then after that I'll do a paragraph element with the class of subtitle.

55
00:02:59,670 --> 00:03:06,240
With some texts like we will tell you which is best again, just to help our user understand what's

56
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:07,020
going on here.

57
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:08,870
Now, two things here.

58
00:03:08,870 --> 00:03:12,020
Please double check your spelling of the word notification.

59
00:03:12,020 --> 00:03:13,520
Very easy to misspell.

60
00:03:14,030 --> 00:03:18,740
In addition, overall, just do a double check of all the HTML that we just wrote because very easy

61
00:03:18,740 --> 00:03:20,610
to make several typos inside of here.

62
00:03:20,630 --> 00:03:25,520
Make sure you've got columns and then column, column and column down there as well.

63
00:03:26,820 --> 00:03:27,040
Yes.

64
00:03:27,060 --> 00:03:28,050
I'm going to save this.

65
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:33,780
Now, we're not going to see any autocomplete appear right away because we remove the div with the class

66
00:03:33,780 --> 00:03:34,560
of autocomplete.

67
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:36,700
So in fact, we're probably going to get a JavaScript error.

68
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:40,740
I just want to do a quick refresh and make sure that we see the tutorial on the screen.

69
00:03:40,740 --> 00:03:42,270
That's what I really want to see right now.

70
00:03:43,020 --> 00:03:44,250
So I'm going to go back over.

71
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,920
Going to refresh and yep, I definitely see that appear.

72
00:03:48,580 --> 00:03:52,150
So now we can go back and we can start to wire up the two different autocomplete.

73
00:03:52,150 --> 00:03:56,460
So we want to have one that's going to be rendered into right there and the other two right there.

74
00:03:56,470 --> 00:04:00,370
So quick pause and we're going to make sure that we render both these auto completes in the next video.
