1
00:00:01,460 --> 00:00:05,450
Now that we have all of our data inside the on input function, let's make sure that we can iterate

2
00:00:05,450 --> 00:00:07,130
over this list of movies right here.

3
00:00:07,130 --> 00:00:12,290
And for every movie that we have fetched, we're going to try to create a div element that kind of summarizes

4
00:00:12,290 --> 00:00:12,970
the movie.

5
00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:15,950
In particular, I want to take every movie that we fetch.

6
00:00:15,980 --> 00:00:20,840
I want to get the poster printed out as an image on the screen, and I want to show the title for every

7
00:00:20,840 --> 00:00:21,830
movie as well.

8
00:00:22,310 --> 00:00:23,720
So let's get to it.

9
00:00:25,040 --> 00:00:29,690
I'm going to remove that console.log and I'm going to replace it with a four of loop.

10
00:00:29,900 --> 00:00:34,040
So I'll save for let movie of movies like so.

11
00:00:35,690 --> 00:00:37,730
Now we can use a four of loop right here.

12
00:00:37,730 --> 00:00:39,020
We could use a normal for loop.

13
00:00:39,020 --> 00:00:41,930
We could use a while loop a for each map statement.

14
00:00:41,930 --> 00:00:44,240
It's really up to you personally.

15
00:00:44,240 --> 00:00:48,950
I rather enjoy using four of loops because they're really easy to see and pretty easy to understand

16
00:00:48,950 --> 00:00:49,580
as well.

17
00:00:50,150 --> 00:00:54,890
So as we start to iterate over this list of movies right here, we're going to get the movie variable

18
00:00:54,890 --> 00:00:55,790
inside the loop.

19
00:00:55,970 --> 00:01:01,250
So that movie variable is going to be the same objects that we're looking at inside of our console right

20
00:01:01,250 --> 00:01:01,760
here.

21
00:01:02,270 --> 00:01:08,090
So that right there is going to be the first movie variable and then we're going to go over the second

22
00:01:08,300 --> 00:01:09,770
movie and then so on.

23
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:12,610
So now inside of my loop.

24
00:01:13,570 --> 00:01:14,950
I'm going to create a div.

25
00:01:20,440 --> 00:01:22,990
And then going to set the inner html on this div.

26
00:01:22,990 --> 00:01:25,450
So I'll say div inour html.

27
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:28,250
I'm going to use a set of tactics here.

28
00:01:29,170 --> 00:01:33,910
Like so because I want to have a multi lined string so I can nicely format my html though.

29
00:01:33,910 --> 00:01:38,530
I want to write out make note that you are supposed to use back here.

30
00:01:38,530 --> 00:01:41,920
We cannot use single quotes to form a multi-line string in JavaScript.

31
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:45,700
That would be a syntax error, so make sure you have a back tick character instead.

32
00:01:46,620 --> 00:01:53,160
Then inside of here, I'm going to display an image that's going to show the poster for my movie.

33
00:01:54,010 --> 00:01:57,310
To get the URL for this image or the CRC property.

34
00:01:57,310 --> 00:02:00,490
Let's take another quick look at the movie object that we are working with.

35
00:02:01,110 --> 00:02:04,320
So again, this is the movie object that we are currently working with right here.

36
00:02:04,470 --> 00:02:10,380
Notice that it has a poster property and that is a URL to the poster image for this movie.

37
00:02:11,810 --> 00:02:16,850
Also take note that it's poster with a capital P, so we'll need to make sure that we spell the property

38
00:02:16,850 --> 00:02:19,040
with capital P inside of our code as well.

39
00:02:20,850 --> 00:02:21,570
So back over here.

40
00:02:21,570 --> 00:02:23,790
I'm going to set the Z on the image.

41
00:02:24,760 --> 00:02:29,290
And remember to inject a JavaScript variable into a string formed with back ticks.

42
00:02:29,290 --> 00:02:36,670
We use a dollar sign curly braces like so and we'll say movie dot poster with a capital P.

43
00:02:37,710 --> 00:02:39,780
Now, this right here is not quite correct.

44
00:02:39,780 --> 00:02:41,820
There's a very small gotcha in there.

45
00:02:41,970 --> 00:02:47,640
In order to write out a correct image tag, we're supposed to write Z a set of double quotes and then

46
00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:49,140
our link inside of there.

47
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:51,360
To whatever it might be.

48
00:02:52,070 --> 00:02:57,260
Right now, if we ran this code right here, it would just take whatever the URL is and stick the URL

49
00:02:57,260 --> 00:02:59,810
directly in without any double quotes.

50
00:03:00,140 --> 00:03:04,850
So in other words, we would end up with something like that, which is not quite what we want.

51
00:03:04,880 --> 00:03:06,980
Again, we want to have some double quotes around it.

52
00:03:07,310 --> 00:03:11,120
So to make sure we get double quotes around, well, we have to put them in ourselves.

53
00:03:11,150 --> 00:03:14,840
So I'm going to put double quote right there and a double quote on the other side.

54
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:18,940
Next up, I'm going to put an H one right after it.

55
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:21,470
Inside that one.

56
00:03:21,470 --> 00:03:25,910
I'm going to try to show the title of the movie so we can get the title of the movie by referencing

57
00:03:25,910 --> 00:03:27,110
the title property.

58
00:03:27,110 --> 00:03:29,420
And again, notice that it has a capital T.

59
00:03:30,530 --> 00:03:31,700
Inside the one.

60
00:03:32,460 --> 00:03:36,060
I'll do dollar sign curly braces with movie title.

61
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:39,500
Okay.

62
00:03:39,530 --> 00:03:40,460
So it looks pretty good.

63
00:03:40,850 --> 00:03:45,860
So now the last thing we need to do is take the div we just created and insert it into our DOM somewhere

64
00:03:45,860 --> 00:03:47,210
so that we can actually see it.

65
00:03:47,750 --> 00:03:52,670
Let's go back over to our index.html and we're going to make sure that we create some element inside

66
00:03:52,670 --> 00:03:56,780
there that's going to list out all these different divs that we are creating.

67
00:03:57,520 --> 00:03:58,690
So I'll go back over.

68
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:05,530
I'll find where we have our class container and I'm going to add in a div with an ID of target.

69
00:04:05,710 --> 00:04:10,960
This is not a really good practice right here to use an ID of Target because, well, we might end up

70
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:15,490
with many different targets, so to speak, or things that we want to render content to inside of our

71
00:04:15,490 --> 00:04:16,329
application.

72
00:04:16,540 --> 00:04:21,220
But to be honest, we're going to very quickly replace this div with something else like very, very

73
00:04:21,220 --> 00:04:21,730
soon.

74
00:04:21,730 --> 00:04:24,370
And that's why I'm just going to use it here very temporarily.

75
00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:32,890
So now back after we create our div, we can use a query selector to select that element with ID of

76
00:04:32,890 --> 00:04:34,120
target that we just added.

77
00:04:35,020 --> 00:04:37,150
They'll do a document query selector.

78
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:39,790
I'll look for pound target.

79
00:04:40,540 --> 00:04:44,410
And I'll append child the div we just created.

80
00:04:46,630 --> 00:04:46,960
Okay.

81
00:04:46,990 --> 00:04:47,830
And that should be it.

82
00:04:49,110 --> 00:04:50,250
So I'm going to save this.

83
00:04:50,550 --> 00:04:51,520
I'll go back over.

84
00:04:51,540 --> 00:04:52,800
I'll refresh the page.

85
00:04:53,780 --> 00:04:56,000
Then I'll do a search for Avengers.

86
00:04:57,030 --> 00:04:58,020
And there we go.

87
00:04:58,440 --> 00:05:01,440
So I can see my first poster right there.

88
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:05,100
I can see a title, the next one, and so on down the list.

89
00:05:05,670 --> 00:05:07,950
So we can definitely at least show some content now.

90
00:05:08,310 --> 00:05:12,870
However, I want you to notice that while I was typing this out, I also got an error over here, which

91
00:05:12,870 --> 00:05:14,040
is kind of unexpected.

92
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:15,690
So let's take a quick pause.

93
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:20,550
It looks like everything worked but didn't quite work out quite as expected because we got an error.

94
00:05:20,700 --> 00:05:22,170
So we'll come back in just a moment.

95
00:05:22,170 --> 00:05:24,450
We're going to figure out why we're seeing this error message.

96
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:25,830
Then we're going to try to fix it.
