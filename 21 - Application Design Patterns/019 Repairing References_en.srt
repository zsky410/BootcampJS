1
00:00:00,420 --> 00:00:02,730
All right, let's continue working on our widget here.

2
00:00:02,760 --> 00:00:07,530
The last thing we have to do is make a couple of updates inside of on input to refer to the elements

3
00:00:07,530 --> 00:00:11,010
that we just selected instead of some elements that we just deleted, actually.

4
00:00:11,010 --> 00:00:15,330
So like, for example, right now, as we loop over all of our different movies and create some divs,

5
00:00:15,330 --> 00:00:21,540
we're trying to append them to document query selector ID of target so that element doesn't exist anymore.

6
00:00:21,540 --> 00:00:25,680
Remember we said that we want to take all these different elements that we create and put them inside

7
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:27,330
of that div right there.

8
00:00:27,780 --> 00:00:30,690
So we just have to update a couple of different references, that's all.

9
00:00:32,110 --> 00:00:32,380
Okay.

10
00:00:32,380 --> 00:00:38,530
So to get started right before the for loop, we're going to take a look at the dropdown element, as

11
00:00:38,530 --> 00:00:43,000
we just discussed in the last video, to make sure that we open up the menu, we have to add the is

12
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,100
active class to that element right there.

13
00:00:45,490 --> 00:00:52,720
So right above the for loop, I'll say dropdown dot class list add and we're going to add on the class

14
00:00:52,750 --> 00:00:54,430
is dash active.

15
00:00:55,360 --> 00:00:58,510
So we're going to do that right after we fetch all of our data successfully.

16
00:00:58,510 --> 00:01:02,860
So we're going to fetch all of our data, open up the dropdown, and then add in all of our movies to

17
00:01:02,860 --> 00:01:03,280
it.

18
00:01:04,370 --> 00:01:06,290
So then inside of our for loop.

19
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:10,420
As I just mentioned, this element right here doesn't exist anymore.

20
00:01:10,450 --> 00:01:16,870
Instead, we want to apply or append all these different divs that we create to the results wrapper.

21
00:01:16,870 --> 00:01:19,540
And the results wrapper is that thing right there?

22
00:01:21,340 --> 00:01:27,040
So on the query selector, I'm going to delete the query selector and I will replace it with results

23
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:27,790
wrapper.

24
00:01:29,480 --> 00:01:29,780
All right.

25
00:01:29,780 --> 00:01:31,160
Just one or two more changes.

26
00:01:31,160 --> 00:01:37,490
If we go back over to the Burma documentation, you'll recall that as we show each individual item inside

27
00:01:37,490 --> 00:01:41,960
the dropdown, they're supposed to be anchor elements with a class of dropdown item.

28
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:47,370
Right now, as we loop through all of our different videos or our different movies, we are creating

29
00:01:47,370 --> 00:01:48,480
a dive element.

30
00:01:48,480 --> 00:01:49,530
So that's not quite correct.

31
00:01:49,530 --> 00:01:52,140
We need to update that to be an anchor element instead.

32
00:01:52,780 --> 00:01:58,420
So to do so, I'm going to update the document create element to make an anchor tag or a instead of

33
00:01:58,420 --> 00:01:58,930
div.

34
00:02:00,150 --> 00:02:04,680
And then to be complete, we should probably update the div variable name since we're technically not

35
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:06,030
creating a div anymore.

36
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:11,350
A name for this could be like anchor because we are creating an anchor element, but that doesn't really

37
00:02:11,350 --> 00:02:13,690
convey the context of the code we're writing here.

38
00:02:14,140 --> 00:02:16,300
I personally kind of like the name option.

39
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:21,670
Option might seem a little bit weird, but the idea here is that we are creating like a dropdown or

40
00:02:21,670 --> 00:02:22,870
in autocomplete.

41
00:02:22,870 --> 00:02:28,000
And inside there we're going to show a lot of different options of movies that users can click to select

42
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:28,750
one of these.

43
00:02:29,020 --> 00:02:31,900
So I think the term option kind of makes sense in that context.

44
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:38,430
So I'm now going to go through and update div right there and right there as well to refer to the option

45
00:02:38,430 --> 00:02:40,470
variable since Div doesn't exist anymore.

46
00:02:41,190 --> 00:02:44,610
They'll change that to option and on append child.

47
00:02:44,610 --> 00:02:46,110
I'll change it to option as well.

48
00:02:47,810 --> 00:02:48,050
Okay.

49
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:52,560
Just one or two more quick changes inside of the option element.

50
00:02:52,580 --> 00:02:58,160
We currently have the image, which is definitely good, but we have the movie text inside of an H one,

51
00:02:58,160 --> 00:03:00,050
which might be just slightly too large.

52
00:03:00,170 --> 00:03:03,710
So I'm just going to take off the H one, the opening and the closing tag.

53
00:03:05,030 --> 00:03:05,360
All right.

54
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:08,150
So there should be just one last little thing to do here.

55
00:03:08,450 --> 00:03:10,100
Right above the option element.

56
00:03:10,910 --> 00:03:14,990
As we were just looking at the Wal-Mart documentation, remember I just said that we have to add in

57
00:03:14,990 --> 00:03:18,230
a class of dropdown item to get everything to style nicely.

58
00:03:18,440 --> 00:03:21,070
So right above where we set enriched HTML.

59
00:03:21,110 --> 00:03:24,890
I'm going to also do an option class list add.

60
00:03:26,310 --> 00:03:28,830
Drop down item like so.

61
00:03:30,440 --> 00:03:31,460
And that should be it.

62
00:03:31,700 --> 00:03:35,900
So I'm going to save this and we should be ready to flip back over to our browser and test this out.

63
00:03:36,590 --> 00:03:40,610
So I'm going to go back over, I'm going to refresh, and right away you're going to see that this looks

64
00:03:40,610 --> 00:03:42,440
a lot better than how it looked before.

65
00:03:42,470 --> 00:03:47,630
We've got the nicely bolded label and the input looks a lot better as well because we added in a class

66
00:03:47,630 --> 00:03:48,770
of input to that thing.

67
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:53,190
So now inside of here, I'm going to do a search for Avengers.

68
00:03:54,380 --> 00:04:00,230
And as soon as I do so, I see this nice dropdown open and so I can kind of hover over each of these.

69
00:04:00,230 --> 00:04:02,180
I get the nice and a hover effect.

70
00:04:02,180 --> 00:04:03,860
I got the nice finger right there.

71
00:04:03,890 --> 00:04:06,890
All the styling that you're seeing here is coming from Boma.

72
00:04:07,070 --> 00:04:11,300
And so I know that working with Boma and having to understand this dropdown stuff was kind of probably

73
00:04:11,300 --> 00:04:11,810
annoying.

74
00:04:11,810 --> 00:04:15,680
But I think you can agree with me that this looks pretty awesome right here.

75
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:17,329
Like this definitely looks really good.

76
00:04:17,899 --> 00:04:21,769
Now, as good as it looks, there's definitely still some things we have to do to make our widget work

77
00:04:21,769 --> 00:04:22,730
as expected.

78
00:04:22,970 --> 00:04:27,350
In particular, you might recall that we spoke about all the different ways in which our.

79
00:04:28,140 --> 00:04:29,580
Dropdown is going to behave.

80
00:04:30,550 --> 00:04:35,320
Remember we had said stuff like, Oh yeah, if a user clicks outside the dropdown, close the menu.

81
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:38,980
Well, right now, if I click outside the dropdown, that thing stays open.

82
00:04:38,980 --> 00:04:40,540
So definitely not appropriate.

83
00:04:40,870 --> 00:04:45,550
In addition, if I do another search, so let's say that I look up Dark Knight.

84
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:53,010
I'm going to see as I scroll down that all those results get appended to the very end of the list.

85
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:54,870
So we still have a little bit of work to do.

86
00:04:54,870 --> 00:04:58,950
So let's take a quick pause right here and continue solving a couple of these little issues in the next

87
00:04:58,950 --> 00:04:59,520
video.
