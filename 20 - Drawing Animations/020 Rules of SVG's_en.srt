1
00:00:01,190 --> 00:00:02,640
We got an SVG to show up.

2
00:00:02,660 --> 00:00:06,560
Let's now take a look at a couple of diagrams and understand how we work with them in general.

3
00:00:07,340 --> 00:00:07,910
Okay.

4
00:00:07,910 --> 00:00:09,050
Here we go.

5
00:00:09,050 --> 00:00:09,800
Right here.

6
00:00:10,310 --> 00:00:11,330
So first things first.

7
00:00:11,330 --> 00:00:16,700
Whenever we want to show a SVG or essentially some set of random shapes that we want to draw onto the

8
00:00:16,700 --> 00:00:19,690
screen, we're going to place an SVG element.

9
00:00:19,700 --> 00:00:23,960
When we create an SVG element, we're going to assign it a height and a width.

10
00:00:24,110 --> 00:00:28,160
So you can see that we did back that back inside the markup that we just put together right here.

11
00:00:28,760 --> 00:00:34,280
So when we wrote that out, it essentially created a big square inside of our HTML document that was

12
00:00:34,280 --> 00:00:36,680
200 pixels tall, 200 pixels wide.

13
00:00:36,920 --> 00:00:43,010
This SVG element is kind of like a canvas of sorts, and on this canvas we can draw different shapes.

14
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:46,310
We can very easily see the SVG element in action.

15
00:00:46,310 --> 00:00:53,450
If we go back over to our index.html file, use our element inspector and then hover over the SVG so

16
00:00:53,450 --> 00:00:55,980
we can very easily see the full span of the SVG.

17
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,660
Now, so again, this is kind of like a canvas of sorts or kind of like an area.

18
00:00:59,660 --> 00:01:02,330
We can draw as much stuff as we want to.

19
00:01:04,280 --> 00:01:07,940
The SVG element has a couple of interesting properties around it.

20
00:01:08,030 --> 00:01:13,250
One of the most important things we need to understand is the axes that it has or those dimensions.

21
00:01:13,670 --> 00:01:19,820
So the top left corner of the SVG SVG element is what we refer to as the origin.

22
00:01:20,360 --> 00:01:25,820
We're going to be working with a lot of coordinate pairs, so like x y values in order to place in size

23
00:01:25,820 --> 00:01:28,160
different shapes inside the SVG element.

24
00:01:28,760 --> 00:01:30,750
All the coordinate pairs that we are going to work with.

25
00:01:30,770 --> 00:01:33,590
Use the origin of the top left hand side.

26
00:01:34,010 --> 00:01:35,030
The x axis.

27
00:01:35,030 --> 00:01:40,130
Then increases from left to right, and the y axis increases from top to bottom.

28
00:01:40,820 --> 00:01:47,810
So if we were to try to show some different points on here, a point right here might be at about 175

29
00:01:47,810 --> 00:01:49,630
pixels along the X direction.

30
00:01:49,640 --> 00:01:56,000
So that means we go over 175 pixels from left to right and then 20 pixels in the Y direction.

31
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:00,170
So that means we go down from 0 to 20 in the vertical direction.

32
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:07,740
Then down here, this would be 190 pixels over to the right in 190 pixels down.

33
00:02:08,220 --> 00:02:14,190
So again, origin is always at the top left and we have our x axis running from left to right, and

34
00:02:14,190 --> 00:02:17,100
the y axis goes from top down to the bottom.

35
00:02:17,850 --> 00:02:24,690
So we're going to very rarely for our application anyways have negative x or y values because negative

36
00:02:24,690 --> 00:02:31,650
x or y would mean that we are trying to place a point outside of our available area of the SVG.

37
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:37,800
So like out over here and that would not display inside the SVG for something to display it must have

38
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:41,760
an x and y coordinate within the bounds of our SVG.

39
00:02:42,460 --> 00:02:44,760
Right now we've got 200 pixels wide and tall.

40
00:02:44,770 --> 00:02:50,950
So in other words, anything that we want to show up must be placed within 0 to 200 on the x axis and

41
00:02:50,950 --> 00:02:52,990
0 to 200 on the Y axis.

42
00:02:54,380 --> 00:02:57,350
So that's a bit more about SVG elements in general.

43
00:02:58,540 --> 00:03:04,870
Now inside of an SVG element, we can place a variety of different other elements, such as a circle,

44
00:03:04,900 --> 00:03:08,290
and as you would guess, this is going to draw a circle out onto the screen.

45
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:11,170
There are several other shapes we can place as well.

46
00:03:11,320 --> 00:03:16,060
So we can do a polygon, which is essentially a shape with an arbitrary number of sides.

47
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:18,430
We can do a circle, which is what we just did.

48
00:03:18,460 --> 00:03:22,540
We can draw any lips or a square or otherwise a rectangle.

49
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:29,740
We could also draw a path, which is essentially a line that has some arbitrary kind of direction to

50
00:03:29,740 --> 00:03:30,090
it.

51
00:03:30,100 --> 00:03:34,510
So we can draw out a path that kind of like curves and twists around as much as we please.

52
00:03:35,340 --> 00:03:36,330
For our application.

53
00:03:36,330 --> 00:03:39,930
As you probably guess, we're going to end up drawing a circle.

54
00:03:40,790 --> 00:03:46,700
So we're going to draw a really big circle like so and we're going to place our timer text.

55
00:03:46,700 --> 00:03:51,230
So like the countdown thing, that text input, all that kind of stuff is going to be placed inside

56
00:03:51,230 --> 00:03:52,100
of this circle.

57
00:03:53,910 --> 00:03:55,010
Now the circle itself.

58
00:03:55,020 --> 00:03:57,510
There are a couple of different properties we need to understand.

59
00:03:57,810 --> 00:03:59,340
These are pretty basic properties.

60
00:03:59,340 --> 00:04:01,890
So are is the radius of the circle.

61
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:08,490
Remember, a radius is from the center point out to a edge that is separate from the diameter, which

62
00:04:08,490 --> 00:04:12,030
is the full distance from one edge to the opposite edge.

63
00:04:12,420 --> 00:04:15,150
So in this case, we created a circle with the radius of 20.

64
00:04:17,029 --> 00:04:24,200
The C, X and C values are the center point of the circle or where to place the circle on the SVG.

65
00:04:24,440 --> 00:04:30,290
So in our case, because we said C and C of 30, that meant that we could go back over to like this

66
00:04:30,290 --> 00:04:31,400
diagram right here.

67
00:04:32,410 --> 00:04:38,980
So we went over 30 units and then down 30 units and then we placed our circle, the center point of

68
00:04:38,980 --> 00:04:40,390
it at that location.

69
00:04:40,390 --> 00:04:47,110
So you can imagine 30, 30 might be like right there or so we can see that as plainly what happened

70
00:04:47,110 --> 00:04:48,610
inside of our drawing over here.

71
00:04:49,880 --> 00:04:50,070
Okay.

72
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:52,220
So that's some more about drawing a circle.

73
00:04:52,250 --> 00:04:57,050
So now if we want to, we could easily play around with some of these R values and see and see.

74
00:04:57,110 --> 00:05:03,740
So, for example, I can move my circle to the right by increasing the C value that is going to increase

75
00:05:03,740 --> 00:05:07,490
the X value or the center point of the X value for the circle.

76
00:05:07,820 --> 00:05:13,370
So go to like 130 and I'll expect to see this thing shift over by a hundred pixels.

77
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:14,300
Yep.

78
00:05:14,300 --> 00:05:14,990
There we go.

79
00:05:16,980 --> 00:05:22,260
I'm going to revert the C to 30 and I'll try increasing C Y to 130 as well.

80
00:05:22,290 --> 00:05:25,860
So that should move our circle downwards by about 100 pixels.

81
00:05:26,070 --> 00:05:26,580
Yep.

82
00:05:26,580 --> 00:05:27,540
Definitely happen.

83
00:05:28,230 --> 00:05:30,600
And then, of course, we can start to increase the R value.

84
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:33,000
So it could go up to say 120.

85
00:05:33,510 --> 00:05:36,510
And now the radius of our circle is going to be significantly larger.

86
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:41,220
So now the circle is so large that it actually flows off the SVG.

87
00:05:41,430 --> 00:05:45,310
If something is outside the SVG, it means that we just plain can't see it.

88
00:05:45,330 --> 00:05:50,100
So even though the circle is technically off the edge, well, we can't really see it because the SVG

89
00:05:50,100 --> 00:05:51,900
itself is going to clip that.

90
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:54,020
Okay.

91
00:05:54,020 --> 00:05:56,360
So that is the SVG and the circle.

92
00:05:56,780 --> 00:06:02,000
Now, last thing I'm going to do, I'm going to revert the circle back to an R of 20, a C of 30 and

93
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,080
a C of 30.

94
00:06:03,500 --> 00:06:06,710
And then I'm going to copy paste this circle down twice.

95
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:11,320
Then on the second one, I'll change the course to 130.

96
00:06:12,590 --> 00:06:15,860
And on the third one, I'll change the CI to 130 as well.

97
00:06:17,670 --> 00:06:20,490
And so now I can see very easily three circles on the screen.

98
00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:24,960
So for us, we're just going to show one circle, but I just want you to know that we could show as

99
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:27,360
many shapes inside of an SVG as we wish.

100
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:28,620
Within reason, of course.

101
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:32,650
So I'm going to reduce this back down to just one circle like so.

102
00:06:33,630 --> 00:06:33,960
All right.

103
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:39,990
So we now understand some of the basics around drawing a shape inside of an SVG and some properties

104
00:06:39,990 --> 00:06:41,460
around SVG as well.

105
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:45,870
But now we need to understand how we can actually draw something like, well, what we were going for

106
00:06:45,870 --> 00:06:49,740
before this thing over here where we only see the outline of a circle.

107
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:54,480
In addition, we want to make sure that we can kind of like have a line of sorts that goes around at

108
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:55,350
the same time.

109
00:06:55,890 --> 00:06:59,070
So we still need to understand a little bit more about how we're going to achieve that.

110
00:06:59,070 --> 00:07:01,770
So quick pause right here and I'll see you in just a minute.
