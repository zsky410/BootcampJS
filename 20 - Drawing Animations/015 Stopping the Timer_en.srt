1
00:00:00,880 --> 00:00:04,059
There's really just one last thing we have to do to implement our timer.

2
00:00:04,059 --> 00:00:06,380
So back inside of our browser.

3
00:00:06,400 --> 00:00:10,210
I'm going to change the timer down to just 3 seconds and then start it up.

4
00:00:10,210 --> 00:00:14,050
So I'll see that it's going to count down to zero, but then continue into the negatives.

5
00:00:14,050 --> 00:00:19,030
So to finish up the timer aspect of this application, all we have to do is add in a check to stop the

6
00:00:19,030 --> 00:00:21,220
timer automatically whenever it hits zero.

7
00:00:21,700 --> 00:00:24,190
So I'm going to implement that inside my tick method.

8
00:00:24,550 --> 00:00:25,630
So inside of here.

9
00:00:26,530 --> 00:00:32,439
I'm going to say if this time remaining is less than or equal to zero.

10
00:00:33,170 --> 00:00:35,750
Then let's call this dot pause.

11
00:00:37,180 --> 00:00:38,170
To stop.

12
00:00:39,400 --> 00:00:42,370
Our tick method from continuing to be invoked once every second.

13
00:00:43,220 --> 00:00:44,570
Then inside the case.

14
00:00:44,570 --> 00:00:47,330
So if this time remaining is greater than zero.

15
00:00:48,220 --> 00:00:49,630
Then we're going to run the original.

16
00:00:49,630 --> 00:00:50,970
Let's subtract 1/2.

17
00:00:50,980 --> 00:00:53,950
So I'm going to cut that and put it into the case like so.

18
00:00:55,020 --> 00:00:55,400
Yeah, it's.

19
00:00:55,410 --> 00:00:56,430
I'm going to save this.

20
00:00:56,760 --> 00:00:57,620
I'm going to go back over.

21
00:00:57,630 --> 00:00:58,680
We'll do a quick test.

22
00:00:58,680 --> 00:01:01,350
So I'm going to just change this to down to 3 seconds.

23
00:01:01,350 --> 00:01:01,800
So go.

24
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:05,220
Three, two, one, zero, stop.

25
00:01:06,350 --> 00:01:06,560
Okay.

26
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:07,760
So that definitely looks pretty good.

27
00:01:08,450 --> 00:01:08,750
All right.

28
00:01:08,750 --> 00:01:11,540
Well, that's pretty much it for the timer aspect of this thing.

29
00:01:11,570 --> 00:01:15,530
So now you need to start to pivot our focus a little bit and figure out how we're going to get that

30
00:01:15,530 --> 00:01:17,780
animated border to display around this.

31
00:01:17,810 --> 00:01:22,790
So, remember, we want to have some kind of like border that's going to either fill up over time or

32
00:01:22,790 --> 00:01:24,040
count down over time.

33
00:01:24,050 --> 00:01:27,320
We want that thing to update with every tick of a second.

34
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:32,190
The other thing I want you to remember is that we still have to do a little bit of work on our timer

35
00:01:32,190 --> 00:01:37,830
class because we want to make sure that during these very critical stages, like whenever we are starting

36
00:01:37,830 --> 00:01:43,050
up the timer, whenever a second counts down or whenever the timer ends, we're going to make sure that

37
00:01:43,050 --> 00:01:47,570
we watch or emit an event or call a callback or something like that.

38
00:01:47,580 --> 00:01:53,040
So stuff outside of our timer class can kind of hook into or watch for that to occur and then update

39
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:54,660
the actual border animation.

40
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:59,850
Now, one thing I want to focus on right now or just mention really quickly is that our current implementation

41
00:01:59,850 --> 00:02:04,370
of the timer class is like really simple and pretty darn straightforward.

42
00:02:04,380 --> 00:02:08,520
So you can take a look at this thing and really very quickly understand what is going on.

43
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:14,650
If we started to add in all that border updating code into this class right now, well, our time or

44
00:02:14,650 --> 00:02:19,360
class would start to get really confusing really quickly, much harder to understand than it currently

45
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:19,900
is.

46
00:02:20,950 --> 00:02:21,220
Okay.

47
00:02:21,220 --> 00:02:21,880
So quick pause.

48
00:02:21,880 --> 00:02:25,540
We're going to come back the next video and start to implement the ability to watch for these different

49
00:02:25,540 --> 00:02:26,560
things occurring.
