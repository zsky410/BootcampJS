1
00:00:01,500 --> 00:00:05,340
Now that our timer is working pretty well, we need to apply a little bit of styling just to make sure

2
00:00:05,340 --> 00:00:07,920
that everything shows up inside of the actual timer.

3
00:00:08,189 --> 00:00:14,280
The first thing I want to do is replace the start and pause buttons with the icons for like pause and

4
00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:15,960
or start and pause right there.

5
00:00:16,680 --> 00:00:20,770
So to show those icons, we're going to use a free icon library called Font.

6
00:00:20,790 --> 00:00:21,420
Awesome.

7
00:00:21,750 --> 00:00:25,090
I'm going to open up a new browser tab and navigate to font.

8
00:00:25,110 --> 00:00:25,620
Awesome.

9
00:00:28,510 --> 00:00:33,190
So this is a free resource so we can use to show tons of different icons inside of our application.

10
00:00:33,460 --> 00:00:36,790
The first thing we have to do is wire up this library to our app.

11
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:39,640
To do so, we're going to open up one other page.

12
00:00:39,880 --> 00:00:42,130
I'm going to go to CN JS.

13
00:00:44,040 --> 00:00:46,320
Once here we can search for font.

14
00:00:47,040 --> 00:00:47,670
Awesome.

15
00:00:48,770 --> 00:00:50,540
And we'll see a link right here.

16
00:00:50,540 --> 00:00:52,580
So notice that this is a CSS file.

17
00:00:52,580 --> 00:00:54,890
That's how we make use of font awesome inside of our project.

18
00:00:54,890 --> 00:00:58,970
We're going to hook it up as a CSS file, so I'm going to copy that link.

19
00:00:59,690 --> 00:01:02,210
We'll then go back over to our HTML document.

20
00:01:03,500 --> 00:01:04,400
Here it is right here.

21
00:01:04,760 --> 00:01:05,960
I'll go up to my head.

22
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,130
And I'm going to add in a link tag.

23
00:01:10,160 --> 00:01:11,420
So I'll say link.

24
00:01:11,450 --> 00:01:13,670
We're going to use a rel of stylesheet.

25
00:01:15,770 --> 00:01:20,300
And then an F and we can paste in that link that we just copied.

26
00:01:24,820 --> 00:01:25,060
Okay.

27
00:01:25,060 --> 00:01:29,170
So now that we've wired up font awesome, we can take a look at the font awesome documentation and figure

28
00:01:29,170 --> 00:01:30,790
out which icon we want to show.

29
00:01:31,810 --> 00:01:34,360
So go back over to the font documentation.

30
00:01:34,360 --> 00:01:37,270
On the top left hand side is a little search box.

31
00:01:37,720 --> 00:01:41,800
So when you first get start with the icons, of course, you're probably going not going to know exactly

32
00:01:41,800 --> 00:01:43,660
what the name of any icon is.

33
00:01:43,660 --> 00:01:46,120
So it's really up to you to just kind of take a guess.

34
00:01:46,210 --> 00:01:50,560
When I look at these icons, the words that come to my mind are, play for that right there.

35
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:52,870
It's like a play icon and pause.

36
00:01:53,050 --> 00:01:56,350
So I'm just going to take a guess and I'm going to search for play.

37
00:01:58,390 --> 00:02:01,090
And when I search for play, we're going to eventually see some results.

38
00:02:01,210 --> 00:02:01,970
Here we go.

39
00:02:01,990 --> 00:02:05,200
So these are all the different icons that match that search string.

40
00:02:05,450 --> 00:02:06,330
Looks like that one right there.

41
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:07,100
Looks pretty good.

42
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:09,550
So I'll click on that one to figure out how to use it.

43
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:14,650
Now sometimes font awesome website is a really slow, so I'm just going to give this a second to load

44
00:02:14,650 --> 00:02:14,830
up.

45
00:02:14,830 --> 00:02:16,160
Hopefully it resolves quickly.

46
00:02:16,180 --> 00:02:16,500
Okay.

47
00:02:16,510 --> 00:02:17,210
Very good.

48
00:02:17,230 --> 00:02:21,880
So now to actually make use of this icon, you'll see right underneath play is a little eye tag right

49
00:02:21,880 --> 00:02:22,330
there.

50
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:26,190
So that's the HTML that we're going to show in order to show that icon.

51
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:27,970
So I'll click that thing to copy it.

52
00:02:28,630 --> 00:02:30,790
I'll go back over to my HTML document.

53
00:02:32,100 --> 00:02:34,950
I'm going to find my button that says Start.

54
00:02:35,220 --> 00:02:39,000
I'll delete the text that says Start and replace it with that ID tag.

55
00:02:40,460 --> 00:02:41,680
So now I can save this.

56
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:46,090
Go back over to my browser, refresh and I'll see the play button right there.

57
00:02:46,910 --> 00:02:47,450
Okay.

58
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:48,920
So that's definitely good.

59
00:02:48,920 --> 00:02:52,820
So we can definitely repeat the same process to get the pause icon as well.

60
00:02:53,750 --> 00:02:55,100
So I'll search for pores.

61
00:02:57,170 --> 00:03:00,530
Wait another couple of seconds too for it to load?

62
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:00,920
Yup.

63
00:03:00,920 --> 00:03:01,850
That definitely looks good.

64
00:03:01,850 --> 00:03:02,810
So I'll click it.

65
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:07,790
And click on the eye tag again.

66
00:03:08,890 --> 00:03:11,440
I'll go back over to my HTML document, find where we have.

67
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:12,740
Pause inside the button.

68
00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:15,280
I'll delete it and replace it with the eye tag as well.

69
00:03:16,450 --> 00:03:16,720
Yes.

70
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:18,130
I'll say this the second time.

71
00:03:18,870 --> 00:03:19,710
Refresh.

72
00:03:20,300 --> 00:03:21,780
Okay, well, that looks pretty good.

73
00:03:22,780 --> 00:03:23,290
All right.

74
00:03:23,290 --> 00:03:27,550
So for the rest of the styling, I'll be honest with you, it's really just a bunch of CSS and whatnot

75
00:03:27,550 --> 00:03:30,190
that we're going to throw into our HTML document.

76
00:03:30,190 --> 00:03:34,660
So we're going to take a quick pause right here in the next video attached to the video, you're going

77
00:03:34,660 --> 00:03:36,760
to find a zip file inside.

78
00:03:36,760 --> 00:03:40,790
That zip file is going to be an HTML document and a CSS file.

79
00:03:40,810 --> 00:03:42,610
Make sure you download that zip file.

80
00:03:42,700 --> 00:03:47,920
It's going to be called something like timer oh 25 template or something like that.

81
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:52,420
So make sure you download that zip file and find the HTML CSS file inside.

82
00:03:53,460 --> 00:03:57,540
So make sure you grab that and we'll start to integrate that or merge it into our project in just a

83
00:03:57,540 --> 00:03:58,170
moment.
