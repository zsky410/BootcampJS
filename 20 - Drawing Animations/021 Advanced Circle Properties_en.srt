1
00:00:01,260 --> 00:00:05,710
You now have a bit better idea of how an SVG element works along with circle elements.

2
00:00:05,730 --> 00:00:09,720
So now in this video, I want to tell you a little bit more about circles and some special properties

3
00:00:09,720 --> 00:00:10,410
around them.

4
00:00:10,410 --> 00:00:14,370
And this is going to start to help us understand how we're going to finally implement that animation.

5
00:00:14,940 --> 00:00:15,270
Okay.

6
00:00:15,270 --> 00:00:18,060
So a couple of things I want you to understand about circles.

7
00:00:18,450 --> 00:00:23,580
When we draw out a circle using an SVG element, there are really two parts to the circle.

8
00:00:23,670 --> 00:00:29,940
The inside of the circle are kind of like the content inside we refer to as the fill the border, going

9
00:00:29,940 --> 00:00:33,150
around the outside the circle, rather than calling it simply a border.

10
00:00:33,150 --> 00:00:34,890
We instead call it a stroke.

11
00:00:35,450 --> 00:00:41,480
We can change the colour of the fill and the stroke by adding in some additional HTML properties to

12
00:00:41,480 --> 00:00:42,680
our circle element.

13
00:00:42,830 --> 00:00:47,390
We can also change the width of the stroke or the border as well at the same time.

14
00:00:47,870 --> 00:00:49,690
So let's go back over to our HTML file.

15
00:00:49,700 --> 00:00:53,060
We're going to start to play around with these different properties a little bit and see what effect

16
00:00:53,060 --> 00:00:54,530
it actually has on our circle.

17
00:00:56,180 --> 00:00:56,480
Okay.

18
00:00:56,480 --> 00:00:58,370
So I'm going to go back to my HTML file.

19
00:00:58,520 --> 00:01:03,290
I'm going to first change the dimensions of the circle just slightly so we can see these changes to

20
00:01:03,290 --> 00:01:05,390
the fill and stroke a little bit more easily.

21
00:01:05,990 --> 00:01:08,210
So I'm going to increase the radius to 90.

22
00:01:08,900 --> 00:01:13,400
I'm going to take my C to 100 and see Y to 100 as well.

23
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:17,630
Let's save this and refresh our app just to see the effect it has.

24
00:01:18,430 --> 00:01:18,620
Okay.

25
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:20,080
So that's what it looks like now.

26
00:01:20,470 --> 00:01:22,390
Now, quick reminder, just really quickly.

27
00:01:22,390 --> 00:01:24,670
Remember, I run my browser very far, zoomed in.

28
00:01:24,670 --> 00:01:27,700
So you probably see something a little bit closer to that right there.

29
00:01:29,890 --> 00:01:30,180
Okay.

30
00:01:30,190 --> 00:01:32,920
So let's try changing the fill and the stroke.

31
00:01:33,250 --> 00:01:36,760
I'm going to first give myself a little bit of space to work with because we're going to eventually

32
00:01:36,760 --> 00:01:38,560
add in several different properties here.

33
00:01:41,390 --> 00:01:46,850
So I'm going to put in a fill of red and a stroke of blue.

34
00:01:47,240 --> 00:01:50,180
I'm also going to set the stroke with property as well.

35
00:01:50,180 --> 00:01:54,080
So stroke, dash width and I'll pass in ten for that.

36
00:01:54,470 --> 00:01:57,350
So this means make the center of the circle blue or something.

37
00:01:57,470 --> 00:02:00,620
Make the center of the circle red, make the border blue.

38
00:02:00,620 --> 00:02:04,610
And the border should be about ten pixels wide or ten pixels thick.

39
00:02:05,180 --> 00:02:06,350
So let's save this.

40
00:02:06,380 --> 00:02:08,449
Go back over and see what happens.

41
00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:10,039
Well, yep, that's pretty much it.

42
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:12,950
So now we've got the red interior, the blue exterior.

43
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:19,130
If we start to increase the stroke width here to say like 50, the borders can get that much larger.

44
00:02:20,590 --> 00:02:23,920
I'm going to stick with ten for now because it's a little bit easier on the eyes.

45
00:02:24,790 --> 00:02:29,380
There's another very interesting value for Phil that we can use for our application, and it's really

46
00:02:29,380 --> 00:02:31,040
relevant to what we are trying to do.

47
00:02:31,060 --> 00:02:37,420
For the Phil, we could specify a color of transparent, which means make the center of the circle see

48
00:02:37,420 --> 00:02:37,900
through.

49
00:02:38,260 --> 00:02:43,000
So if we use a fill of transparent, that means we could very easily start to see some timer elements

50
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,040
behind this thing or something like that.

51
00:02:45,700 --> 00:02:50,770
So I'll set Phil to Transparent and now the center totally gone and I can see directly through it.

52
00:02:53,170 --> 00:02:53,350
Okay.

53
00:02:53,350 --> 00:02:56,590
So that's some basic additional properties around a circle.

54
00:02:57,500 --> 00:03:02,060
Now there's a couple more that are going to help us modify or play around with that stroke.

55
00:03:02,330 --> 00:03:06,320
So let's take a look at a couple more diagrams and understand what these other properties are that are

56
00:03:06,320 --> 00:03:09,380
going to allow us to modify the border around the exterior.

57
00:03:10,630 --> 00:03:15,580
So the first additional property I want you to understand is stroke, dash, dash array.

58
00:03:16,210 --> 00:03:22,000
We're going to give this a number of value and it's going to specify the length of a dash around the

59
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,730
perimeter or essentially for the border of the circle.

60
00:03:25,150 --> 00:03:28,660
Let's try adding in this property and playing around with it just a little bit.

61
00:03:29,890 --> 00:03:33,760
So I'll go back over to my HTML file and I'm going to add in a stroke.

62
00:03:33,790 --> 00:03:35,950
Dash, dash array.

63
00:03:38,020 --> 00:03:39,640
And I'll start out with ten.

64
00:03:40,390 --> 00:03:46,510
So that means give me a dashboard order and I want each segment of the dash to be ten pixels long and

65
00:03:46,510 --> 00:03:50,440
then a ten pixel gap before the next dash segment.

66
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:51,430
So I'll save this.

67
00:03:51,460 --> 00:03:52,990
Go back over and refresh.

68
00:03:53,650 --> 00:03:59,680
So this means or I can see very easily now I've got about ten pixels of dash and then a ten pixel gap,

69
00:03:59,710 --> 00:04:03,460
then ten pixels dash, ten pixels gap and so on around the exterior.

70
00:04:04,740 --> 00:04:08,250
The statutory property technically accepts two different values.

71
00:04:08,250 --> 00:04:11,340
If we only pass in one, then ten will be used for two.

72
00:04:11,490 --> 00:04:12,960
For both the different values.

73
00:04:13,940 --> 00:04:19,160
The first value we pass in is going to be the length of the dash, and if we pass in a second, it is

74
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:20,029
totally optional.

75
00:04:20,060 --> 00:04:23,960
It will be used as the spacing in between each dash segment.

76
00:04:24,780 --> 00:04:30,180
So for example, if I put in a ten and then a five, that means give me dash lengths of ten and then

77
00:04:30,180 --> 00:04:32,820
spacing in between each of those dashes of five.

78
00:04:34,470 --> 00:04:37,020
So we can save this, go back over and now we'll see.

79
00:04:37,020 --> 00:04:40,950
We've got about ten units of dash and five units of spacing in between.

80
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:47,790
But again, if we just put in the one number, that means give us give us identical dash lengths and

81
00:04:47,790 --> 00:04:48,840
gaps as well.

82
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:51,150
So I'm going to leave it at ten for right now.

83
00:04:52,450 --> 00:04:52,780
Okay.

84
00:04:52,780 --> 00:04:53,870
So this looks good.

85
00:04:53,890 --> 00:04:58,300
I want to remind you of something about properties of circles in general.

86
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:03,490
So if we take a circle and we measure its radius, so that's going to be from the very center point

87
00:05:03,490 --> 00:05:04,660
to the outside edge.

88
00:05:04,660 --> 00:05:07,960
We can calculate the entire perimeter of the circle.

89
00:05:07,960 --> 00:05:14,230
So the total length of the outside edge by using the formula two times pi times the radius.

90
00:05:14,710 --> 00:05:17,440
Now the radius that we just changed our circle to is 90.

91
00:05:17,530 --> 00:05:21,820
So if we do two times PI times 90, we end up with 565.

92
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:27,970
So that means that the total length of the outside edge of the circle is about 565 pixels.

93
00:05:28,770 --> 00:05:35,160
So with that calculation in mind, we can start to draw like a quarter or like a half segment of border

94
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:36,600
around the circle.

95
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:39,480
Let me show you in my terminal.

96
00:05:40,590 --> 00:05:47,430
I'm going to calculate two times math pi times 90 and then divide that by two.

97
00:05:47,580 --> 00:05:49,530
So that gives me about 282.

98
00:05:49,980 --> 00:05:57,330
So if we enter in a dash array of 282, that means that we want to have about half the circle, have

99
00:05:57,330 --> 00:06:00,780
a dash, and then have the half the circle not have a dash.

100
00:06:02,230 --> 00:06:02,440
Yes.

101
00:06:02,440 --> 00:06:06,640
I'm going to go back over and try updating the dash array to about 282.

102
00:06:07,610 --> 00:06:10,310
So if I now save that and then refresh.

103
00:06:10,520 --> 00:06:11,090
There we go.

104
00:06:11,090 --> 00:06:14,420
So I've now got half the circle with a dash, half without it.

105
00:06:15,390 --> 00:06:16,680
We can do something very similar.

106
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:18,780
So two times pi times 90.

107
00:06:18,780 --> 00:06:20,370
And then this time I will.

108
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:21,930
How about multiply?

109
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:25,890
By one quarter SOE 0.25.

110
00:06:26,040 --> 00:06:30,060
So now I would have just a quarter segment if I use that 141.

111
00:06:31,210 --> 00:06:36,940
So now I get a quarter, half a quarter of no dash, half a quarter a dash, half a quarter of no dash.

112
00:06:37,540 --> 00:06:39,730
And then, of course, last thing I want to show you.

113
00:06:40,710 --> 00:06:45,960
Around this perimeter is that if we do the full five, 65 or just slightly less than it, that should

114
00:06:45,960 --> 00:06:51,180
give us just about the entire length of the thing and then leave us just a little bit of a gap.

115
00:06:51,750 --> 00:06:55,410
So I'll do right around 560 and just leave a little bit of a gap.

116
00:06:55,770 --> 00:07:00,720
So now I can see I get a whole bunch of border and then just a tiny little gap at the very edge.

117
00:07:01,650 --> 00:07:06,420
So the next thing I want to tell you about this circle is that the border is always started, started

118
00:07:06,420 --> 00:07:10,110
drawn from the right hand side, and then it draws around clockwise.

119
00:07:10,230 --> 00:07:14,910
And we can see that very easily with the border dash array or the stroke dash array that we just added

120
00:07:14,910 --> 00:07:15,390
on.

121
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:21,420
So it's very clear that the border starts right there and then travels around clockwise until it decides

122
00:07:21,420 --> 00:07:23,220
to hit an empty spot.

123
00:07:24,590 --> 00:07:27,740
We can start to play around with that value of dash array.

124
00:07:27,770 --> 00:07:29,260
It's not going to change it really quickly here.

125
00:07:29,270 --> 00:07:33,140
Several times it's going to start to decrease it to say 550.

126
00:07:34,740 --> 00:07:36,810
And I can see that the gap is a little bit larger.

127
00:07:37,050 --> 00:07:39,540
I can go to 520 little larger.

128
00:07:39,870 --> 00:07:43,470
I go to 480 a little larger yet.

129
00:07:44,790 --> 00:07:45,030
Okay.

130
00:07:45,030 --> 00:07:49,380
So that's how we can get like a just about full border but have a gap at the very end.

131
00:07:49,530 --> 00:07:52,140
So now there's just one last thing I want to show you.

132
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:56,640
I'm going to change the dash array back to the full about 560 or so.

133
00:07:57,530 --> 00:08:01,850
The last property I want to show you is called the Dash Offset.

134
00:08:02,510 --> 00:08:05,960
Now, the dash offset is a really tricky property to understand.

135
00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:11,460
Suffice it to say, if we have a border that goes just about around the entire outside edge.

136
00:08:11,480 --> 00:08:15,920
Dash Offset will introduce an extra little spacing right there.

137
00:08:16,620 --> 00:08:20,190
Let's play around with Dash Offset just to get a sense of what's going on with it.

138
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:28,640
So back on my circle element, I'm going to add on stroke dash, dash offset and I'll start it off at

139
00:08:28,640 --> 00:08:29,210
ten.

140
00:08:29,780 --> 00:08:35,570
So this means in addition to that little space we have right there, give us another extra ten units

141
00:08:35,570 --> 00:08:36,799
of spacing as well.

142
00:08:36,799 --> 00:08:40,789
So that's going to give us a little ten extra units of a white space right there.

143
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:46,280
So I'll save this refresh and I can clearly see ten extra units or about ten extra units.

144
00:08:46,280 --> 00:08:49,310
I don't actually know what ten units looks like, but hey, there's ten right there.

145
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:54,120
So now if I start to increase that value to, say, 20.

146
00:08:55,210 --> 00:08:55,960
Some more.

147
00:08:55,990 --> 00:08:58,780
If I go to say 40, I get more.

148
00:08:58,780 --> 00:09:04,000
Yet if I go to 100 140, that should be about a quarter.

149
00:09:05,380 --> 00:09:11,380
And then if I go to about to what was it, 80 or so to 82, that's going to be about half.

150
00:09:11,380 --> 00:09:16,960
And I can eventually essentially unravel the entire thing by specifying about 560.

151
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:22,060
And so that's going to give me extra white space all the way around that outside edge back to around

152
00:09:22,060 --> 00:09:22,840
right there.

153
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:24,620
Okay.

154
00:09:24,660 --> 00:09:30,660
So the dash array and the dash offset properties are how we're going to actually pull off this animation.

155
00:09:31,170 --> 00:09:33,420
So let's take a pause right here in the next video.

156
00:09:33,450 --> 00:09:37,260
We're going to take another look at these properties and I'll explain exactly how we're going to use

157
00:09:37,260 --> 00:09:40,140
them to actually show the animation on the screen.
