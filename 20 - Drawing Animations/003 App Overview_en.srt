00:00:00,810 --> 00:00:05,490
In this video, we're going to start working on a new little project based entirely inside the browser.

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:10,770
This is going to be a project focusing on just practicing some of our basic JavaScript skills, particularly

3
00:00:10,770 --> 00:00:12,600
classes and functions.

4
00:00:12,660 --> 00:00:16,050
So let's take a look at a mockup and get a better idea of what we're going to be building.

5
00:00:16,620 --> 00:00:16,980
All right.

6
00:00:16,980 --> 00:00:17,640
Here we go.

7
00:00:17,790 --> 00:00:21,960
So we're going to be making a somewhat simple little timer application.

8
00:00:22,110 --> 00:00:24,790
When a user visits our application inside the browser.

9
00:00:24,810 --> 00:00:29,640
We're going to show them a number like 30 right there, a play button and a pause button.

10
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,860
Whenever the user clicks on play.

11
00:00:31,890 --> 00:00:33,960
We're then going to count this timer down.

12
00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:36,590
So in this case, it starts at 30 seconds.

13
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:43,200
After 1/2, we'll go down to 29, then 28, 27 and so on, until eventually gets all the way down to

14
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:43,770
zero.

15
00:00:44,420 --> 00:00:49,430
As that timer is counting down, a user can pause it at any time by clicking on the pause button right

16
00:00:49,430 --> 00:00:52,100
there and then resume it by clicking on play again.

17
00:00:53,180 --> 00:00:56,990
Now, I'm sure this seems like a very simple and straightforward application, kind of basic, kind

18
00:00:56,990 --> 00:00:57,590
of boring.

19
00:00:57,590 --> 00:01:01,010
But there are going to be a couple of elements inside of here that kind of make it a little bit more

20
00:01:01,010 --> 00:01:03,680
challenging and a little bit more interesting overall.

21
00:01:04,760 --> 00:01:08,840
So first thing I want you to notice is that there's this circle around the timer itself.

22
00:01:09,080 --> 00:01:13,670
We're going to have a circle kind of like drawn around the timer element.

23
00:01:13,730 --> 00:01:20,720
And as this timer counts down from 32 to 27, 26 and so on, we're going to essentially revolve the

24
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:21,350
timer.

25
00:01:21,350 --> 00:01:26,450
So you can imagine this as kind of being like a border, and the border is going to kind of fill up

26
00:01:26,480 --> 00:01:30,200
around the outside all the way until it gets to the very top again.

27
00:01:30,680 --> 00:01:34,490
Now, that's kind of a bad description of what's going on, but as soon as we start writing some code,

28
00:01:34,490 --> 00:01:35,630
you'll get a better idea.

29
00:01:35,660 --> 00:01:39,950
The point is that we're going to have an animated little border around the edge of this element.

30
00:01:41,080 --> 00:01:44,620
The other thing we're going to do to make this just a little bit more interesting is we're going to

31
00:01:44,620 --> 00:01:47,650
make sure that a user can click on that number right there.

32
00:01:47,650 --> 00:01:51,310
And whenever they click on it, we're going to turn that thing into a text input.

33
00:01:51,370 --> 00:01:58,720
So a user can change the timer to say, count down from 10 seconds or 5 seconds or whatever else so

34
00:01:58,720 --> 00:02:00,780
it's not fixed at 30 or anything.

35
00:02:00,790 --> 00:02:03,310
A user can change it to any time that they want.

36
00:02:03,490 --> 00:02:07,660
And of course, once it counts down all the way to zero, the user can then click in there, update

37
00:02:07,660 --> 00:02:11,140
the timer to say 60 seconds and start it all over again.

38
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:12,450
Okay.

39
00:02:12,450 --> 00:02:16,420
So although it's going to be kind of straightforward in nature, there are these couple of extra things.

40
00:02:16,420 --> 00:02:20,490
So we're definitely going to have to figure out and the border part in particular is going to actually

41
00:02:20,490 --> 00:02:21,670
be kind of challenging.

42
00:02:21,690 --> 00:02:25,110
We're going to have to figure out some interesting stuff in the browser to really make that work.

43
00:02:25,880 --> 00:02:26,150
All right.

44
00:02:26,150 --> 00:02:29,150
So now that we've got a better idea of what we're going to be working on, let's take a pause right

45
00:02:29,150 --> 00:02:31,880
here and start to do some projects set up in the next video.
