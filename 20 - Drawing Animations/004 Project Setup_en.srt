1
00:00:01,010 --> 00:00:01,370
All right.

2
00:00:01,370 --> 00:00:04,010
Now that we know what we are building, let's flip over to our terminal.

3
00:00:04,010 --> 00:00:07,700
We're going to create a new project directory and start doing a little bit of setup.

4
00:00:08,119 --> 00:00:09,590
So I'm going to go over to my terminal.

5
00:00:09,590 --> 00:00:12,860
I'm inside of a workspace directory of sorts inside of here.

6
00:00:12,860 --> 00:00:16,670
I'm going to make a new project folder that I will call simply timer.

7
00:00:17,270 --> 00:00:21,140
I'll then change into that directory and start up my code editor inside there.

8
00:00:23,470 --> 00:00:30,550
Once my editor is open, I'm going to create an indexed HTML file and in indexed JS file as well.

9
00:00:31,180 --> 00:00:35,680
We're going to put together a little bit of boilerplate inside this HTML document, so let's get to

10
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:36,400
it right away.

11
00:00:36,670 --> 00:00:40,120
At the very top, I'll put in my dock type of HTML.

12
00:00:42,010 --> 00:00:44,230
I'll put in my HTML element.

13
00:00:44,740 --> 00:00:46,030
I'll put in ahead.

14
00:00:47,370 --> 00:00:48,150
A body.

15
00:00:50,190 --> 00:00:53,970
And finally, a script tag with the source of index dogs.

16
00:00:56,760 --> 00:00:57,020
Okay.

17
00:00:57,060 --> 00:00:57,900
Simple enough.

18
00:00:59,560 --> 00:01:05,050
Then inside of indexes, I'll do a quick console log that says Hi there, just so we can make sure that

19
00:01:05,050 --> 00:01:08,860
we correctly hooked up our indexes file to the HTML file.

20
00:01:09,070 --> 00:01:12,670
Once I've got all this stuff put together, I'm going to make sure that I save both files.

21
00:01:12,700 --> 00:01:18,490
I'll then go back over to my terminal and open up that indexed HTML file.

22
00:01:19,190 --> 00:01:23,870
Once it is open I should see a console log inside of my developer console of simply.

23
00:01:23,870 --> 00:01:24,650
Hi there.

24
00:01:25,890 --> 00:01:28,290
So as long as we see that, that means we are good to go.

25
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:29,220
All right.

26
00:01:29,220 --> 00:01:30,570
Some pretty straightforward set up.

27
00:01:30,570 --> 00:01:32,000
So now we've got this all put together.

28
00:01:32,010 --> 00:01:35,640
Let's continue in the next video and we're going to start to discuss how we're going to approach this

29
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:38,070
project and generally architect it out.
