00:00:00,800 --> 00:00:06,380
Attached to this video, you're going to find a zip file called Timer zero 25 template with template

2
00:00:06,380 --> 00:00:07,580
in all capitals.

3
00:00:08,029 --> 00:00:11,840
There are probably two different files attached to this lecture, so make sure you get the one with

4
00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:13,100
the name template inside.

5
00:00:13,490 --> 00:00:18,590
Once you get that file, we're going to unzip it and then take a look at the two files inside.

6
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:22,010
So we've got an indexed HTML file and a style CSS.

7
00:00:22,130 --> 00:00:28,130
So all I did here was add in a couple of additional HTML elements, some class names and some CSS just

8
00:00:28,130 --> 00:00:30,530
to apply a little bit better styling to our timer.

9
00:00:31,250 --> 00:00:35,810
The only reason I'm giving you this is that, well, this really is, of course, about JavaScript.

10
00:00:35,810 --> 00:00:39,230
And so for the most part, we're going to skip over a lot of styling stuff.

11
00:00:39,290 --> 00:00:43,130
I still want you to have some neat looking apps, though, which is why we're usually going to have

12
00:00:43,130 --> 00:00:45,590
some HTML and CSS being provided to you.

13
00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:49,890
So to use these files, I'm going to open up my editor.

14
00:00:51,580 --> 00:00:56,320
And I'm going to first begin by dragging and dropping the indexed HTML file into my editor.

15
00:00:56,890 --> 00:00:59,200
So here's the HTML file that we were just given.

16
00:00:59,560 --> 00:01:03,910
I'm going to select everything inside of here with a command or control a depending upon your operating

17
00:01:03,910 --> 00:01:04,540
system.

18
00:01:04,840 --> 00:01:06,070
I'll copy everything.

19
00:01:06,220 --> 00:01:09,010
I'm going to go back over to my indexed HTML.

20
00:01:09,160 --> 00:01:11,590
So the one that we've been working on for our project.

21
00:01:12,130 --> 00:01:16,240
I'm going to select everything inside of here, delete it and then paste.

22
00:01:18,340 --> 00:01:21,310
So now as we look through here, we're going to see just about everything is the same.

23
00:01:21,310 --> 00:01:26,890
So we still have an SVG element, we still have a circle, the input, the buttons and all that stuff.

24
00:01:26,890 --> 00:01:28,690
Just a slightly different structure.

25
00:01:31,630 --> 00:01:36,280
Next up, I'm going to create a new file called Style CSS.

26
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:40,420
I'll go back over to where we have those two files from the zip file.

27
00:01:40,450 --> 00:01:42,760
I'll find the style case that we just downloaded.

28
00:01:42,790 --> 00:01:44,770
I'm going to drag and drop it into my editor.

29
00:01:45,010 --> 00:01:51,070
I'll select everything inside, copy it, and then paste it into the styled CSS file that we just created

30
00:01:51,070 --> 00:01:51,940
and save.

31
00:01:53,690 --> 00:01:54,140
All right.

32
00:01:54,140 --> 00:01:57,620
So now that everything is saved in updated, I'll flip back over to my browser.

33
00:01:57,650 --> 00:02:00,880
I'll refresh and we get something that looks like this right here.

34
00:02:00,890 --> 00:02:05,210
If I zoom back out to 100%, you'll probably see something that looks like basically that.

35
00:02:06,130 --> 00:02:08,259
So now I can click in here to run the timer.

36
00:02:08,500 --> 00:02:10,720
It's all the exact same logic that we just had.

37
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:11,480
Nothing changed.

38
00:02:11,500 --> 00:02:14,860
All the JavaScript code is identical because, well, we didn't change any of it.

39
00:02:14,860 --> 00:02:15,340
Right?

40
00:02:15,880 --> 00:02:18,120
And now I can click on that thing.

41
00:02:18,130 --> 00:02:23,920
It is the actual text input there, so I can click on it and change it to say 30 seconds and then run

42
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:24,490
it down.

43
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:31,510
I can pause it, change it again to say 60 seconds, run it down, and so on.

44
00:02:32,610 --> 00:02:33,570
So that's pretty much it.

45
00:02:34,820 --> 00:02:38,330
Now, one thing I want to really highlight is that that really is a text input.

46
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:45,680
The only thing we did was some CSIS was make sure that it doesn't display a border and it also doesn't

47
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:47,750
get highlighted when you actually select it.

48
00:02:47,780 --> 00:02:50,810
So if I actually do a little bit of fancy stuff here really quickly.

49
00:02:51,710 --> 00:02:56,240
You'll see that there is an outline property being set inside the style CSS file of none.

50
00:02:56,240 --> 00:02:59,660
So that's why it doesn't really look like an input, but it technically is.

51
00:03:00,690 --> 00:03:01,080
All right.

52
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:02,780
Well, I hope you enjoyed this project.

53
00:03:02,790 --> 00:03:08,190
We definitely learned a lot along the way about SVG things, handling set intervals, classes, where

54
00:03:08,190 --> 00:03:10,320
to store information and all that kind of stuff.

55
00:03:10,530 --> 00:03:13,800
We still have a lot of code to write and a lot of projects to work on, however.

56
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:17,940
So let's take a pause right here and start working on our next project in just a moment.
