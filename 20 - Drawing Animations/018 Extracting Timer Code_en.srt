1
00:00:01,260 --> 00:00:03,290
Well, our timer is all done for right now.

2
00:00:03,300 --> 00:00:06,200
I said at the end of the last video that we're going to start working on the border.

3
00:00:06,210 --> 00:00:09,240
There actually is one last very quick thing I want to do right now.

4
00:00:09,240 --> 00:00:14,310
Our index file has a lot of different code inside of it, so it has our timer implementation at the

5
00:00:14,310 --> 00:00:18,600
top, then has some query selectors and then where we actually create the timer as well.

6
00:00:18,840 --> 00:00:24,390
Just to clean up our project a little bit, I would like to extract the class definition for the timer

7
00:00:24,390 --> 00:00:28,770
into a separate file, just so that our index file is a little bit easier to read.

8
00:00:29,340 --> 00:00:34,650
So to do so inside of my root project directory, I'm going to make a new JavaScript file called Timer

9
00:00:34,890 --> 00:00:35,670
JS.

10
00:00:36,770 --> 00:00:39,230
I'll then go back over to my index case file.

11
00:00:39,620 --> 00:00:43,910
I'm going to select the entire timer class, so I'm going to highlight the entire thing.

12
00:00:47,910 --> 00:00:48,420
There we go.

13
00:00:48,420 --> 00:00:50,430
All the way to the bottom of the class definition.

14
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:51,870
I'm going to cut it.

15
00:00:52,830 --> 00:00:55,770
I'm going to go over to timer DJs and paste.

16
00:00:57,180 --> 00:00:58,650
And we'll go ahead and save it.

17
00:01:00,430 --> 00:01:03,020
And then finally, finally, I'll go back over to index dogs.

18
00:01:03,070 --> 00:01:05,650
Just do a little bit reformatting just to make it look nice.

19
00:01:06,120 --> 00:01:09,280
The last thing we need to do is open up our indexed HTML file.

20
00:01:09,310 --> 00:01:13,750
We're going to make sure that we get a script tag for the timer JS file that we just created.

21
00:01:14,170 --> 00:01:17,500
So inside of index HTML, I'll find my script tag.

22
00:01:18,700 --> 00:01:24,040
We're going to copy it, paste a duplicate, and I'll make sure that the top script tag is going to

23
00:01:24,040 --> 00:01:30,250
get our timer JS file because we need to run timer dogs before we can safely run index dogs.

24
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:34,660
So the first one right here, I'll make sure it says timer dogs like so.

25
00:01:36,780 --> 00:01:39,880
All right, let's save all these files, save all the changes we just made.

26
00:01:39,900 --> 00:01:43,210
We'll just do another quick test just to make sure everything still works.

27
00:01:43,230 --> 00:01:43,590
Yep.

28
00:01:43,590 --> 00:01:44,160
No errors.

29
00:01:44,160 --> 00:01:45,600
That means everything is good to go.

30
00:01:46,460 --> 00:01:46,690
Okay.

31
00:01:46,730 --> 00:01:47,600
Well, this looks pretty good.

32
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:52,820
So another quick pause right here and we'll actually start working on that border in just a moment.
