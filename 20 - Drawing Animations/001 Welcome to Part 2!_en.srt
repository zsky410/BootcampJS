Hello and welcome.

2
00:00:01,800 --> 00:00:06,390
My name is Stephen Greider, and I'm going to be taking over for Colt for part two on this course.

3
00:00:06,420 --> 00:00:08,189
Congratulations on making it this far.

4
00:00:08,220 --> 00:00:12,390
Hopefully you've had fun so far and you're ready to keep learning a lot more about JavaScript.

5
00:00:12,630 --> 00:00:16,020
Now, right away, I want to tell you that part two of this course is going to be a little bit different

6
00:00:16,020 --> 00:00:17,010
than part one.

7
00:00:17,220 --> 00:00:22,320
In part one, you were learning a lot of different individual topics around JavaScript, and you were

8
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:24,990
really focused on the basic features of the language.

9
00:00:24,990 --> 00:00:29,040
So understanding things like objects, classes, functions and so on.

10
00:00:29,460 --> 00:00:32,940
And you were in general not building a lot of larger apps.

11
00:00:33,180 --> 00:00:37,350
So in part two, we're really going to change the structure of the course significantly and we're going

12
00:00:37,350 --> 00:00:39,000
to have a very different structure.

13
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:44,370
So in part two, we're going to be covering fewer topics, but every topic that we do cover is going

14
00:00:44,370 --> 00:00:46,320
to be in way greater detail.

15
00:00:46,620 --> 00:00:51,030
So this is where you're going to really get to apply all of your newfound JavaScript skills.

16
00:00:51,790 --> 00:00:56,950
In addition, we're going to have a lot more focus on design patterns and some more advanced concepts

17
00:00:56,950 --> 00:00:58,450
and features of JavaScript.

18
00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:04,780
So this is a lot more about building larger applications and really giving you some experience and confidence

19
00:01:04,780 --> 00:01:06,280
in building your own apps.

20
00:01:06,940 --> 00:01:11,080
The last thing I want to mention is that as we go through this second part of the course for all these

21
00:01:11,080 --> 00:01:14,410
different apps we build, we're going to be doing a lot of refactoring.

22
00:01:14,770 --> 00:01:19,930
The idea here is that I want to show you for every app several different ways to approach any given

23
00:01:19,930 --> 00:01:20,650
problem.

24
00:01:20,830 --> 00:01:23,530
I don't want to show you just one way and say this is it.

25
00:01:23,530 --> 00:01:25,550
This is the only way to build this application.

26
00:01:25,570 --> 00:01:31,030
Instead, I want to give you a toolbox that you can use and a toolbox of different skills to build your

27
00:01:31,030 --> 00:01:31,930
own apps.

28
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:33,300
Okay.

29
00:01:33,300 --> 00:01:37,110
So now that we have a better idea of what we're going to be doing inside of part two, let's take a

30
00:01:37,110 --> 00:01:38,010
quick pause right here.

31
00:01:38,010 --> 00:01:42,060
We're going to come back the next video and start to discuss the first application that we're going

32
00:01:42,060 --> 00:01:42,930
to be working on.
