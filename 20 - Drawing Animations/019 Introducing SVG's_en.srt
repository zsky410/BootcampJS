1
00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:00,860
All right.

2
00:00:00,870 --> 00:00:04,260
Time to start working on the animated border that is going to go around the timer.

3
00:00:04,290 --> 00:00:08,310
Now, at this point, I've really just showed you this circle and said, oh, yeah, like the border

4
00:00:08,310 --> 00:00:10,140
is going to fill up or something like that.

5
00:00:10,140 --> 00:00:12,060
That's not really a really good explanation.

6
00:00:12,060 --> 00:00:15,750
So I'm going to show you the finished product of what we're trying to actually build here.

7
00:00:15,870 --> 00:00:17,400
So here's what we're going for.

8
00:00:18,790 --> 00:00:21,250
I want to show a full border around our timer.

9
00:00:21,250 --> 00:00:25,630
And then whenever we click on that play button, we're going to essentially kind of empty the thing

10
00:00:25,630 --> 00:00:27,820
out until it gets all the way down to zero like so.

11
00:00:28,630 --> 00:00:29,410
That's the goal.

12
00:00:29,450 --> 00:00:31,330
I'll refresh and do it one more time.

13
00:00:31,510 --> 00:00:32,509
Yeah, there we go.

14
00:00:32,530 --> 00:00:33,940
So that's what we're trying to build.

15
00:00:33,970 --> 00:00:36,400
Now I've got some good news and bad news for you.

16
00:00:36,430 --> 00:00:39,070
The good news is that, well, we could definitely do this.

17
00:00:39,070 --> 00:00:41,020
Like that is within the realm of possibility.

18
00:00:41,020 --> 00:00:46,180
We can figure out how without any library or anything like that, we can show that kind of animation.

19
00:00:46,630 --> 00:00:48,560
The bad news, there's always bad news.

20
00:00:48,580 --> 00:00:54,100
The bad news is we cannot make this kind of animation right here using just CSS borders alone.

21
00:00:54,460 --> 00:00:59,890
So if you're used to using borders with CSS and normal styling, unfortunately, we cannot use that

22
00:00:59,890 --> 00:01:02,260
to do an animation like the one you just saw.

23
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:09,400
So to do the animation, we're going to instead have to learn about a little side topic called SVG elements.

24
00:01:10,950 --> 00:01:14,160
SVG stands for Scalable Vector Graphics.

25
00:01:14,310 --> 00:01:20,190
This is going to be a set of HTML elements that we can use to draw kind of arbitrary shapes on the screen.

26
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:24,960
In this video, I'm going to give you a quick demonstration of an SVG element, and then we're going

27
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:29,190
to take a look and understand some of the rules governing them and eventually understand how we're going

28
00:01:29,190 --> 00:01:32,520
to use an SVG to make that kind of animation that we just saw.

29
00:01:33,260 --> 00:01:33,620
Okay.

30
00:01:33,620 --> 00:01:34,640
So here we go.

31
00:01:34,730 --> 00:01:37,880
We're going to flip over to our indexed HTML file.

32
00:01:38,060 --> 00:01:40,580
SVG elements are HTML elements.

33
00:01:40,580 --> 00:01:44,330
And so for this demonstration, we're going to write out some HTML inside of here.

34
00:01:45,110 --> 00:01:47,150
Right above my input element.

35
00:01:48,420 --> 00:01:54,300
I'm going to add in an SVG with a height of 200 and a width of 200.

36
00:01:56,190 --> 00:01:58,800
Then inside there, I'm going to place a circle.

37
00:01:58,830 --> 00:02:01,440
Now, of course, I'm going to tell you what all this stuff is in just a moment.

38
00:02:01,440 --> 00:02:03,450
But right now, just a quick demonstration.

39
00:02:04,050 --> 00:02:13,170
My circle element is going to have a property of R equals 20, C X equals 30, and C Y equals 30.

40
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:14,990
Okay.

41
00:02:14,990 --> 00:02:17,720
So there's the HTML markup that we just added in.

42
00:02:17,990 --> 00:02:19,550
Let's then save this.

43
00:02:21,190 --> 00:02:23,600
We're going to go back over to our browser refresh.

44
00:02:23,620 --> 00:02:26,830
And then, lo and behold, we see a circle up here on the screen.

45
00:02:27,160 --> 00:02:29,620
So kind of humble beginnings here, so to speak.

46
00:02:29,620 --> 00:02:34,240
But this is essentially the technique or strategy that we're going to use to get that fancy border to

47
00:02:34,240 --> 00:02:34,810
show up.

48
00:02:35,480 --> 00:02:35,780
All right.

49
00:02:35,780 --> 00:02:39,770
So now that we can plainly see that there is some kind of circle and we can draw kind of like arbitrary

50
00:02:39,770 --> 00:02:40,520
shapes here.

51
00:02:40,550 --> 00:02:41,280
Let's pause.

52
00:02:41,300 --> 00:02:42,230
We'll come back in a moment.

53
00:02:42,230 --> 00:02:46,910
And I'm going to give you a lot more details on how SVG is work and how we're going to eventually use

54
00:02:46,910 --> 00:02:48,470
them to do that animation.
