00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:00,450
Hey.

2
00:00:00,450 --> 00:00:01,350
Welcome, everyone.

3
00:00:01,350 --> 00:00:04,230
In this section, we're doing things a little bit differently.

4
00:00:04,230 --> 00:00:10,350
I'm calling it other useful things JavaScript assortment, hence the assorted bread on the right.

5
00:00:10,680 --> 00:00:16,260
As we've gone through this course so far, I've been trying hard to integrate new features, new JavaScript

6
00:00:16,260 --> 00:00:19,680
features as organically as possible, wherever they make sense.

7
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:25,380
So we introduced string template literals really early on when we were talking about strings, we talked

8
00:00:25,380 --> 00:00:28,860
about Lead and Const, which are new ways of creating variables.

9
00:00:28,860 --> 00:00:29,940
We talked about them right?

10
00:00:29,940 --> 00:00:35,460
When we introduced variables, I introduced four of and four in along with the regular for loops and

11
00:00:35,460 --> 00:00:36,240
while loops.

12
00:00:36,390 --> 00:00:41,880
Now we can't do that for every single feature in JavaScript as much as I would like to, because some

13
00:00:41,880 --> 00:00:47,130
of them are more advanced or they require a whole bunch of previous knowledge in order for them to be

14
00:00:47,130 --> 00:00:47,850
useful.

15
00:00:47,850 --> 00:00:50,220
So that's what this section is here for.

16
00:00:50,460 --> 00:00:54,780
This section is going to cover this group of three new features in JavaScript.

17
00:00:54,780 --> 00:01:00,630
It's really more than three rest and spread are kind of separate things, but these are not necessarily

18
00:01:00,630 --> 00:01:04,560
related except in the fact that they are new features in JavaScript.

19
00:01:04,560 --> 00:01:10,140
So I couldn't find an easy way to integrate them organically into another part of the course.

20
00:01:10,140 --> 00:01:13,020
So they get lumped into this assortment section.

21
00:01:13,020 --> 00:01:17,370
So we're going to talk about rest and spread de structuring and default function parameters.

22
00:01:17,610 --> 00:01:22,290
We also have some other new features we haven't covered yet and those will get their own sections.

23
00:01:22,290 --> 00:01:24,150
So we're going to return to objects.

24
00:01:24,150 --> 00:01:29,820
Then we'll talk more about classes and then later on we'll also cover asynchronous JavaScript and async

25
00:01:29,820 --> 00:01:30,570
functions.

26
00:01:30,660 --> 00:01:36,330
So this section, as I mentioned, is really focused on rest and spread default function parameters

27
00:01:36,330 --> 00:01:37,650
and D structuring.

28
00:01:37,650 --> 00:01:38,910
So that's what we're here for.

29
00:01:38,940 --> 00:01:42,420
We're going to start with the second one, default function parameters.
