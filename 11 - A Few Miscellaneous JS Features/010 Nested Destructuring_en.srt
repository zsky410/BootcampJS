00:00:00,090 --> 00:00:05,130
Next up, sticking with the structuring, I'd like to show you how we can work with nested objects and

2
00:00:05,130 --> 00:00:11,610
arrays and combine what we've seen so far to extract individual values into variables to unpack them.

3
00:00:11,730 --> 00:00:15,660
So I have an array of objects still going with the marathon theme.

4
00:00:15,660 --> 00:00:21,750
So each object is a marathon runner and they are ordered still by finishing position.

5
00:00:21,750 --> 00:00:27,570
So we have gold, silver and bronze from the 2016 Olympic Marathon, the men's marathon.

6
00:00:27,780 --> 00:00:37,620
If I wanted to extract, let's say, the country of second place right here, Ethiopia using D structuring,

7
00:00:37,830 --> 00:00:39,390
I'm inside of an array.

8
00:00:39,420 --> 00:00:42,060
So I'm going to start with the array braces.

9
00:00:42,060 --> 00:00:44,100
I'm going to set the whole thing equal to results.

10
00:00:44,790 --> 00:00:47,940
And in this array I want the second element.

11
00:00:48,420 --> 00:00:55,020
So I'm going to skip the first one and then I'm now in the second element or I'm in that position and

12
00:00:55,020 --> 00:00:56,160
we have an object.

13
00:00:57,090 --> 00:00:59,790
So inside of that object I want country.

14
00:01:02,450 --> 00:01:06,980
It's kind of annoying that my editor is putting it on multiple lines, so I'll leave it like this so

15
00:01:06,980 --> 00:01:08,000
you can see it here.

16
00:01:08,120 --> 00:01:11,390
If I run it right now, let's see what we get in country.

17
00:01:11,540 --> 00:01:13,160
We get Ethiopia.

18
00:01:13,700 --> 00:01:15,560
So this comma is crucial.

19
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:17,490
We're skipping that first element.

20
00:01:17,510 --> 00:01:21,600
If I wanted to extract something from that first object.

21
00:01:21,620 --> 00:01:24,980
Let's say I wanted to get first name, which is Eliot.

22
00:01:25,220 --> 00:01:26,750
So I'll write first.

23
00:01:26,750 --> 00:01:32,960
And if I want to give it a different name or a different variable name, let's go with gold winner.

24
00:01:35,800 --> 00:01:38,580
I'll refresh and I'll look at gold winner.

25
00:01:38,590 --> 00:01:43,330
It said to Eliot and our country variable is still set to Ethiopia.

26
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:49,000
So the point here is just to show you that we can combine the syntax, it can get a little crazy.

27
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:53,890
And I don't recommend nesting and doing a whole bunch of structuring with nested structures.

28
00:01:53,890 --> 00:01:59,410
Instead, if you have like super nested stuff, I think it's a lot easier to understand what's going

29
00:01:59,410 --> 00:01:59,710
on.

30
00:01:59,710 --> 00:02:06,130
If so, rather than getting country this way, maybe it would be easier to understand if we did const

31
00:02:06,130 --> 00:02:16,600
skip the first element and then go with silver medal equals results and then from inside of silver metal

32
00:02:16,630 --> 00:02:19,420
we could extract country.

33
00:02:22,580 --> 00:02:26,480
So it's an extra line, but some might say it's easier to read.

34
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:32,060
This isn't bad, but if you had more nesting that you were trying to work with and continue to structure

35
00:02:32,060 --> 00:02:35,780
from, let's say, instead of country, we had an array.

36
00:02:35,810 --> 00:02:41,420
Maybe someone is from multiple countries or they've competed for multiple countries before and we wanted

37
00:02:41,420 --> 00:02:44,010
to extract something or unpack a value from there.

38
00:02:44,030 --> 00:02:49,080
Then we would have another array and it just gets complicated to the structure from.

39
00:02:49,100 --> 00:02:50,560
So just keep that in mind.

40
00:02:50,570 --> 00:02:51,840
You can nest it.

41
00:02:51,860 --> 00:02:52,640
That's it.

42
00:02:53,060 --> 00:02:53,690
I'm done.
