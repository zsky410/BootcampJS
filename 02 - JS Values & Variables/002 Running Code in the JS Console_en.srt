1
00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:04,890
Before we go any further, I want to stop and talk about where I'll be writing my code, at least for

2
00:00:04,890 --> 00:00:06,780
this section in general.

3
00:00:06,780 --> 00:00:11,400
Throughout the rest of the course, we write our code in a JavaScript file, a standalone file.

4
00:00:11,550 --> 00:00:15,000
It could be 100 lines, it could be ten lines, it could be 10,000 lines.

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,870
We write the code and we run the code afterwards or separately.

6
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:22,410
For now, we're going to run our code in a more immediate way.

7
00:00:22,440 --> 00:00:25,740
We're going to use the JavaScript console in Chrome.

8
00:00:25,740 --> 00:00:29,040
So definitely, definitely recommend you install Chrome if you don't have it.

9
00:00:29,040 --> 00:00:32,610
Now, other browsers have a console as well and you can use that.

10
00:00:32,610 --> 00:00:36,090
But if you want to be on the same page as me, I would use the chrome console.

11
00:00:36,270 --> 00:00:38,160
So here I have chrome open.

12
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:39,330
You could be on any web page.

13
00:00:39,330 --> 00:00:42,090
It doesn't matter and I'm going to pull up the console.

14
00:00:42,420 --> 00:00:44,130
So we have a couple of different options.

15
00:00:44,130 --> 00:00:51,420
I like to use a shortcut, but first, if you go to view developer and JavaScript console right there,

16
00:00:51,450 --> 00:00:52,350
you can click that.

17
00:00:52,350 --> 00:00:54,870
Also take note of that shortcut on a mac.

18
00:00:54,870 --> 00:00:57,060
It is command option J.

19
00:00:57,930 --> 00:00:58,920
And it takes a moment.

20
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:00,120
Here is my console.

21
00:01:00,330 --> 00:01:01,710
Notice there's different tabs.

22
00:01:01,710 --> 00:01:06,960
If this is all new to you, we'll be working in the console tab so I can type code right away.

23
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:08,400
This is not valid code.

24
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:10,830
I get an error message but see this flow.

25
00:01:10,830 --> 00:01:13,470
I type something, I hit enter and I get a result.

26
00:01:13,470 --> 00:01:18,120
This is different than typing our code in a file, saving the file and then running the file.

27
00:01:18,420 --> 00:01:22,380
That's the more traditional standard approach and there's a reason for that.

28
00:01:22,380 --> 00:01:24,960
This is not a great place to write large applications.

29
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:26,970
Nothing you write is actually saved.

30
00:01:26,970 --> 00:01:29,430
But when we're just experimenting, we're just starting out.

31
00:01:29,430 --> 00:01:31,710
We want to talk about numbers, for example.

32
00:01:31,710 --> 00:01:36,960
It's very easy for us to explore and see how things work without getting caught up in the workflow.

33
00:01:36,990 --> 00:01:39,600
So just for this section, we'll be working in the console.

34
00:01:39,630 --> 00:01:43,920
Usually the console is used for debugging, for trying things out.

35
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:47,670
Like I said, it's not a good place to actually write applications.

36
00:01:47,700 --> 00:01:51,630
The other thing is that my console might look a little bit different than yours.

37
00:01:51,630 --> 00:01:56,970
I have changed the colors to make it a little easier to see if you want to learn how to do that.

38
00:01:56,970 --> 00:02:00,660
I have a YouTube video on it, but it's really not at all important.

39
00:02:00,660 --> 00:02:04,770
It will work exactly the same as yours, even if you have the light theme.

40
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:06,660
A couple of other things I'll point out.

41
00:02:06,660 --> 00:02:13,410
You can resize this, you can close it back down by exiting or using the same shortcut you use to open

42
00:02:13,410 --> 00:02:13,530
it.

43
00:02:13,530 --> 00:02:16,680
So for me it is command option J and now it's gone.

44
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:23,760
Also right here, if you click on this three dot more icon, I don't know what to call it.

45
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:29,220
You can change where the dock appears if you want it on the side, the right, the left, or you can

46
00:02:29,220 --> 00:02:32,340
actually pop it out into its own window like this.

47
00:02:32,340 --> 00:02:39,360
So now I have two windows, but this console is connected to this window here and that's pretty much

48
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:39,840
it.

49
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:43,200
Again, we're using this for this section to make our life easier.

50
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:44,220
It's too much setup.

51
00:02:44,220 --> 00:02:49,500
It bogs us down to create new files and save them and open them up correctly every time we learn something

52
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:50,580
new early on.

53
00:02:50,580 --> 00:02:52,290
But again, that's where we're going.

54
00:02:52,290 --> 00:02:55,110
So that's the console command option J on a mac.

55
00:02:55,260 --> 00:02:57,600
Next up, we'll actually start writing code.
