00:00:00,090 --> 00:00:03,080
Welcome everyone to the first coding section of the course.

2
00:00:03,090 --> 00:00:08,490
We're starting out with the most essential fundamental parts of pretty much any language, but especially

3
00:00:08,490 --> 00:00:11,130
with JavaScript values and variables.

4
00:00:11,130 --> 00:00:16,590
The building blocks of the language, the stuff we learn in this section will come up again and again

5
00:00:16,590 --> 00:00:19,920
in pretty much every line of code we write through the end of the course.

6
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:21,330
Very, very important stuff.

7
00:00:21,330 --> 00:00:22,320
But a couple of goals.

8
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:27,510
First off, by the end of the section, we want to understand what primitive types are, what are the

9
00:00:27,510 --> 00:00:30,330
different primitive types, and we want to be able to work with them.

10
00:00:30,690 --> 00:00:33,930
We'll talk about creating variables to different ways with lead.

11
00:00:33,930 --> 00:00:37,200
In contrast to keywords, we'll compare and contrast the two.

12
00:00:37,230 --> 00:00:41,190
We'll also talk about something called VAR, which some of you may be familiar with.

13
00:00:41,310 --> 00:00:46,710
We'll create string template literals and we'll work with common mathematical operations, different

14
00:00:46,710 --> 00:00:49,980
string methods and other useful bits of functionality.

15
00:00:50,220 --> 00:00:53,040
But we're going to start by talking about primitive types.

16
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:59,100
So every language out there, at least every language I've worked with, has a group of types, different

17
00:00:59,100 --> 00:01:05,459
categories for data, fundamental pieces, sort of like DNA of the language we need to work with information,

18
00:01:05,459 --> 00:01:07,650
store information, whatever it is.

19
00:01:07,650 --> 00:01:11,910
We need to represent data in our code, whether it's a large app or a small app.

20
00:01:11,910 --> 00:01:17,250
So imagine we had this form, this is HTML, CSS, no JavaScript involved.

21
00:01:17,250 --> 00:01:21,690
When this form is submitted, suppose that we're working with it in JavaScript.

22
00:01:21,690 --> 00:01:24,240
We want to analyze it, we want to add it to a database.

23
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:25,560
We'll do something with it.

24
00:01:25,890 --> 00:01:31,440
We would need to be able to represent the different information, the different values a user had entered

25
00:01:31,440 --> 00:01:32,700
using JavaScript.

26
00:01:32,820 --> 00:01:35,850
So there's different types with just a simple form like this.

27
00:01:35,850 --> 00:01:38,220
There's at least three different types of information.

28
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:43,260
We have words somebody is going to type words here and here and here.

29
00:01:43,260 --> 00:01:47,640
So that would be textual information, which in JavaScript is called a string.

30
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:49,800
We have numeric data.

31
00:01:49,890 --> 00:01:55,860
This rating here, while the user is not actually typing a number in JavaScript, we would represent

32
00:01:55,860 --> 00:02:02,880
the value using a number 1 to 5, maybe will allow them to do zero, so 0 to 5, but it's a numeric

33
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:03,510
value.

34
00:02:03,720 --> 00:02:08,699
And then we've got this down here, the checkbox I agreed to the terms, blah blah blah blah blah.

35
00:02:08,729 --> 00:02:09,840
True or false?

36
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:11,039
Yes or no.

37
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:17,880
We could use a number to represent that zero or one, or we could do something arbitrary, 50 or 51.

38
00:02:17,880 --> 00:02:23,850
As long as we are consistent, we could use text, the string or the piece of text, yes or no.

39
00:02:23,850 --> 00:02:29,940
But instead the simplest solution is to use a third type called boolean, which is a simple, true or

40
00:02:29,940 --> 00:02:31,770
false, yes or no value.

41
00:02:32,130 --> 00:02:33,600
So back to this slide.

42
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:34,500
Primitive types.

43
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:39,780
In JavaScript, we have a group of these super, super basic primitive types, the different categories

44
00:02:39,780 --> 00:02:43,800
for values, the different ways we can store information at the lowest level.

45
00:02:44,190 --> 00:02:48,150
So some of them are self explanatory like number and make sense.

46
00:02:48,150 --> 00:02:49,560
It's a numeric value.

47
00:02:49,590 --> 00:02:53,580
Another category is string, which we already talked about briefly.

48
00:02:53,580 --> 00:02:55,590
It is text words.

49
00:02:55,590 --> 00:03:00,360
It could be a number, but they're inside quotation marks, so it's treated as text.

50
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:06,240
We have booleans which are true or false values, and then we have these things null and undefined.

51
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:09,210
We'll spend time on each one of these types in this section.

52
00:03:09,420 --> 00:03:12,510
And we also have two more that we're not going to talk about just yet.

53
00:03:12,510 --> 00:03:17,520
Symbol and big int nowhere near as common as these five, but they do exist.

54
00:03:17,790 --> 00:03:18,990
So that's where we're going.

55
00:03:18,990 --> 00:03:23,310
We're going to start by just surveying each one of these types, understanding what they are, how they

56
00:03:23,310 --> 00:03:26,640
work, how we create variables with them, a whole bunch of stuff.

57
00:03:26,670 --> 00:03:27,630
So let's get started.
