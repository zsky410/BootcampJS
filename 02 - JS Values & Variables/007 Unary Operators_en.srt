00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:03,900
In the last video we saw that we could have a variable like score.

2
00:00:03,930 --> 00:00:05,370
Let's say it starts at zero.

3
00:00:05,400 --> 00:00:09,390
We're making some sort of board game or a Tetris or something in the browser.

4
00:00:09,660 --> 00:00:15,270
We have a score variable to keep track of the user score and we could update it by doing this score

5
00:00:15,270 --> 00:00:19,960
equals score plus let's say ten if the user scores ten points.

6
00:00:19,980 --> 00:00:21,420
Now score is ten.

7
00:00:21,450 --> 00:00:27,000
There's also a shorthand for changing the value of a variable without having to reference the name again.

8
00:00:27,090 --> 00:00:32,250
So instead of score equals score plus ten, we can do score plus equals.

9
00:00:32,280 --> 00:00:33,360
Let's go with one.

10
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:39,520
This is the same as saying score equals score plus one plus equals.

11
00:00:39,540 --> 00:00:43,010
Is just going to update score by one in this case.

12
00:00:43,020 --> 00:00:44,790
So score is 11.

13
00:00:45,300 --> 00:00:48,050
Now we could also do it by something other than one.

14
00:00:48,060 --> 00:00:51,240
We could add ten again, score plus equals ten.

15
00:00:51,270 --> 00:00:52,770
Score is now 21.

16
00:00:53,340 --> 00:00:59,670
Now we can also do the same thing with subtraction and other operators like score minus equals.

17
00:00:59,700 --> 00:01:02,520
Say that the user did something bad in the game.

18
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:05,850
They lose points, minus equals 100.

19
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:08,560
Now score is -79.

20
00:01:08,580 --> 00:01:12,240
Let's reset it to let's go with 150.

21
00:01:12,660 --> 00:01:17,860
And then let's say we had another variable like bonus, which we call multiplier.

22
00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:18,930
That's kind of long.

23
00:01:18,930 --> 00:01:21,690
How about bonus mult instead of multiplier?

24
00:01:21,690 --> 00:01:23,490
And this will be three.

25
00:01:24,390 --> 00:01:31,110
So if we wanted to multiply the score by three or by whatever this multiplier is, you get a star in

26
00:01:31,110 --> 00:01:33,090
the game or something that multiplies your score.

27
00:01:33,450 --> 00:01:35,490
We could do score times equals.

28
00:01:35,490 --> 00:01:40,800
And then I just wanted to show you can use other variable names to do this score times equals bonus

29
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:41,370
moult.

30
00:01:41,490 --> 00:01:47,100
We now are just saying take score and multiply it by whatever this variable is, which is three and

31
00:01:47,100 --> 00:01:49,230
then save that new value to score.

32
00:01:49,260 --> 00:01:52,990
We also have divide equals or slash equals.

33
00:01:53,010 --> 00:01:58,320
Most of the time you'll see plus and minus, and a lot of the time you just want to increment by one

34
00:01:58,320 --> 00:01:59,550
or decrement by one.

35
00:01:59,550 --> 00:02:04,590
And there's another shortcut and even shorter way of doing that because it's done so commonly.

36
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:07,620
Often we're doing things where we have a variable, a number.

37
00:02:07,650 --> 00:02:12,450
You need to add one to it, and then later add one more and one more like a counter, for example,

38
00:02:12,450 --> 00:02:17,400
to keep track of certain things, how many times they happen or how many times you want something to

39
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:18,120
occur.

40
00:02:18,420 --> 00:02:20,460
And let's do an example of that.

41
00:02:20,460 --> 00:02:23,580
Let counter equal zero.

42
00:02:23,790 --> 00:02:29,790
If I wanted to add one to it instead of plus equals one, there's something called a urinary operator.

43
00:02:29,820 --> 00:02:33,840
Urinary operators are operators where there's only one side.

44
00:02:34,170 --> 00:02:39,030
This right here has two sides counter plus three right, the left and the right.

45
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:41,070
This has one side.

46
00:02:41,070 --> 00:02:43,410
And this is just going to add one plus.

47
00:02:43,410 --> 00:02:45,420
Plus, we'll add one to counter.

48
00:02:45,450 --> 00:02:50,070
So now counter is one and we can do the same thing.

49
00:02:50,100 --> 00:02:53,010
Let's do it one more time or three more times.

50
00:02:53,010 --> 00:02:53,460
Who knows?

51
00:02:53,460 --> 00:02:59,430
So we have counter set to four, if I can spell it, and we can now do the same, but decrements it

52
00:02:59,430 --> 00:03:02,760
counter minus minus will subtract one.

53
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:04,500
So counter right now is four.

54
00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:08,040
If I do counter minus minus, we end up with three.

55
00:03:09,030 --> 00:03:09,540
Cool.

56
00:03:09,540 --> 00:03:11,070
So I just wanted to show you those.

57
00:03:11,070 --> 00:03:12,300
You'll see them all the time.

58
00:03:12,300 --> 00:03:14,700
Plus equals minus equals star equals.

59
00:03:14,700 --> 00:03:16,680
But then also the urinary operators.

60
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:18,600
Plus plus and minus minus.
