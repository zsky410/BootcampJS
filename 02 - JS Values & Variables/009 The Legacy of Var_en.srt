00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:04,080
Next up, a quick side note about the old way of making variables.

2
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:08,460
Before letting cost were a thing, you had to use the var keyword.

3
00:00:08,460 --> 00:00:13,110
So var and then the same exact format variable name equals some value.

4
00:00:13,470 --> 00:00:16,400
Now I'm showing it to you, not because you should use it.

5
00:00:16,410 --> 00:00:22,530
There's really no situation where it makes sense to use these days, but you will see it all the time.

6
00:00:22,530 --> 00:00:28,080
If you research online, if you're looking at older code bases, even if you just Google variables and

7
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:33,930
JS, the first result still uses VAR, so it still works.

8
00:00:33,930 --> 00:00:36,480
You can make a variable and do everything you need to do.

9
00:00:36,690 --> 00:00:43,050
It's just not ideal and it's hard to explain exactly why right now until we talk about things like functions

10
00:00:43,050 --> 00:00:44,700
and conditionals and blocks.

11
00:00:44,880 --> 00:00:48,300
So for now, just know that var is the old way of doing it.

12
00:00:48,300 --> 00:00:53,820
You shouldn't really be writing var declarations unless for some reason you're working on an old code

13
00:00:53,820 --> 00:00:55,770
base where var is used everywhere.

14
00:00:55,770 --> 00:00:58,650
But I did want to show it to you just so that you're aware of it.

15
00:00:58,650 --> 00:01:00,450
It's something we can't really ignore.

16
00:01:00,540 --> 00:01:08,880
So we could make a variable using var let's do var eggs equals 12 and we have eggs and everything else

17
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:10,290
works exactly the same.

18
00:01:10,380 --> 00:01:11,550
Eggs plus.

19
00:01:11,550 --> 00:01:12,180
Let's do plus.

20
00:01:12,180 --> 00:01:14,190
Plus we now have 13 eggs.

21
00:01:14,910 --> 00:01:17,160
We can reset it so it's not like.

22
00:01:17,160 --> 00:01:24,240
KONST It's more like let let's go with eggs equals zero we ate all the eggs or maybe an evil raccoon

23
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:26,340
ate them all and now we're down to zero.

24
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:27,420
So that's it.

25
00:01:27,420 --> 00:01:29,010
It works just like let.

26
00:01:29,010 --> 00:01:32,460
But there are some significant differences once we talk about scoping.

27
00:01:32,460 --> 00:01:37,500
So I don't want you to think that it's exactly identical to lit, otherwise there'd be no reason to

28
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:38,550
use that over var.

29
00:01:38,580 --> 00:01:42,180
There are some differences in how they work in certain situations.

30
00:01:42,330 --> 00:01:45,090
Also, I just want to talk about this briefly.

31
00:01:45,090 --> 00:01:46,410
Light and cost are new.

32
00:01:46,410 --> 00:01:50,780
As I mentioned, the relatively new at least compared to the lifespan of JavaScript.

33
00:01:50,790 --> 00:01:55,470
If we go to MSDN, let's look at let it scroll down to the very bottom.

34
00:01:55,470 --> 00:02:02,250
You'll see a browser support or browser compatibility chart or table, and it shows you green versus

35
00:02:02,250 --> 00:02:06,180
yellow and red would be for no support in certain browsers.

36
00:02:06,390 --> 00:02:10,229
You can see that LUT is supported across all the major browsers.

37
00:02:10,229 --> 00:02:15,450
It looks like Internet Explorer doesn't fully support it, but if you click here, it's a very small

38
00:02:15,450 --> 00:02:17,070
edge case or it's not an edge case.

39
00:02:17,190 --> 00:02:23,160
There's a specific situation where light is not as optimized, but it still works, so it's not going

40
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:25,320
to cause any problems or errors anyway.

41
00:02:25,320 --> 00:02:29,310
The point here is that light is supported everywhere you need to use it.

42
00:02:29,310 --> 00:02:33,060
So because of that, there's not really a good reason to use VAR anymore.

43
00:02:33,090 --> 00:02:39,030
It used to be that light and cost weren't fully supported in all the main browsers and that was a good

44
00:02:39,030 --> 00:02:43,110
reason to at least know about Var and potentially use it.

45
00:02:43,110 --> 00:02:46,410
These days there's not really a case for VAR, that's it.

46
00:02:46,410 --> 00:02:47,910
Var is the old way of doing things.

47
00:02:47,910 --> 00:02:49,290
You'll probably will see it.

48
00:02:49,290 --> 00:02:50,700
I don't recommend you use it.
