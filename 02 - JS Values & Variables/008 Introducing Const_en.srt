00:00:00,090 --> 00:00:04,650
Two videos ago, I mentioned that let is one option for making a variable.

2
00:00:04,680 --> 00:00:07,360
There's also another keyword called const.

3
00:00:07,380 --> 00:00:10,350
It stands for constant, so it works the same way.

4
00:00:10,350 --> 00:00:15,750
We use the keyword const space and then a variable name equals a value.

5
00:00:15,900 --> 00:00:21,000
But there's one really essential difference, which is that you cannot change the value of const.

6
00:00:21,030 --> 00:00:26,490
Once you set it, once it's initialized with the value, it is set, it's constant.

7
00:00:26,730 --> 00:00:30,990
So if you try to do this const age equals 17, that's fine.

8
00:00:30,990 --> 00:00:34,410
But then if you try and add one to age, you'll get an error.

9
00:00:34,530 --> 00:00:35,610
It's not allowed.

10
00:00:35,610 --> 00:00:36,870
You'll get in trouble.

11
00:00:37,080 --> 00:00:37,950
So let's try it.

12
00:00:37,950 --> 00:00:42,420
Let's do const year equals 1973.

13
00:00:43,620 --> 00:00:50,250
If I try and do year plus equals one type error assignment to constant variable.

14
00:00:50,250 --> 00:00:51,420
You cannot do that.

15
00:00:51,420 --> 00:00:53,190
I can't change it at all.

16
00:00:53,190 --> 00:00:56,280
I can't do plus plus I can't do.

17
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:59,970
Year equals 2010.

18
00:00:59,970 --> 00:01:02,310
It is set and it's there for good.

19
00:01:02,820 --> 00:01:04,560
So why would you use const?

20
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:11,400
Well, here's a couple of simple scenarios where you just need a label, a name for always constant

21
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:14,670
value, something that you'll use in your code, for example.

22
00:01:14,670 --> 00:01:20,790
PY It's a constant, you'll use it or you could use it if you were making some sort of app with circles

23
00:01:20,790 --> 00:01:21,930
that were being drawn all the time.

24
00:01:21,930 --> 00:01:23,340
You need to calculate parts.

25
00:01:23,550 --> 00:01:28,020
I don't know different things in the circle you could use PY and give it a name instead of having your

26
00:01:28,020 --> 00:01:30,720
code riddled with 3.14159.

27
00:01:31,080 --> 00:01:35,580
Same thing days in a week min height for ride instead of just a number.

28
00:01:35,580 --> 00:01:40,980
That doesn't really make sense to look at you give it a label and this also makes sure that it doesn't

29
00:01:40,980 --> 00:01:41,520
change.

30
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:43,470
But that's not the only use for Const.

31
00:01:43,470 --> 00:01:48,690
In fact, later on when we talk about arrays and objects, you'll see that const is more useful than

32
00:01:48,690 --> 00:01:49,680
you might think.

33
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:55,230
When we get to those data structures, more complicated types for values, you'll see that it's a lot

34
00:01:55,230 --> 00:01:55,920
more useful.

35
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:58,800
And it's not just for making things that never change.

36
00:01:59,430 --> 00:02:04,740
I won't get into it now, but for now what we know is that lit allows you to define a variable as this

37
00:02:04,740 --> 00:02:08,520
const let allows you to change that variable whenever you want.

38
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:09,900
Const does not.

39
00:02:09,900 --> 00:02:18,330
Also, if we do define a variable with const or let let's pick one like people count equals ten.

40
00:02:18,660 --> 00:02:25,110
If I want to define a variable using lit, I cannot use people count even though I'm using a different

41
00:02:25,110 --> 00:02:29,730
keyword let instead of const people count has been taken.

42
00:02:29,850 --> 00:02:34,230
It's not available, so you cannot have variables with the same name.

43
00:02:34,230 --> 00:02:36,240
Even though one is constant, one is let.
